  1.  Explain how the cardiac action depolarization and repolarization propagates through the heart.
  2.  Explain how the EKG is measured from the electrical potentials generated outside the cardiac cells.
  3.  Explain how the propagation of the cardiac action potential correlates with the wave-form of the EKG e.g. p-wave (atrial depolarization), PQ interval (AV nodal delay), QRS wave (ventricular depolarization) and T-wave (ventricular repolarization).
