  It wasn't a huge surprise but Gary wasn't ready to record.  I showed him how I set things up and we got him up and running on ExamSoft so he can look at the questions and target the correct material in his videos.
  
  Also no surprise but he decided to go with videos only.  So he obviosuly didn't get much done the first part of the month on his notes.
  
  Hopefully we'll get more done tomorrow.

** [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659907/][Good review of hormoal changes associated with parturition.]]   I was asked why pogesterone goes down before parturition.  It looks like it isn't completely known but part of it is tht DHEA androgen feeds into the sythesis pathway past the progesterone.  So progesterone can go down while estrogen goes up.

  I'll have a better idea how much time we need for video recording    I've been able to protect time here in June as I mentioned I would do in order to do this study guide revision, and ppt revision, and prep for re-recording the videos.

  Can you look at your schedule for halfdays that I have blocked off later in June for just for this recording -
  June 20th, Thursday in the AM and
  June 21st, Friday in the PM, and
  June 24th, Monday in the AM.

  I realize the old presumed deadline of June 30 has been moved unfortunately to the 26th, but videos will be the last thing that we will have to do.

Hi, guys.

Now that our materials are in its time to start working on the faculty guides.  Next week is the fourth of July so I’m starting them the week after on Friday afternoon at 2:30.  This is half an hour later than when Mike was doing his for the BBC block so that Anne can make it.

Thanks,
Tom S.

** DONE [#A] Check folders to see who is still late with their materials.
