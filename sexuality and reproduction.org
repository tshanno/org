  It wasn't a huge surprise but Gary wasn't ready to record.  I showed him how I set things up and we got him up and running on ExamSoft so he can look at the questions and target the correct material in his videos.
  
  Also no surprise but he decided to go with videos only.  So he obviosuly didn't get much done the first part of the month on his notes.
  
  Hopefully we'll get more done tomorrow.

  Talked to Gary.  He's open to calling the case "abnormal genital tract bleeding" and to making the patient younger.  He said that the students get the break down for likilihood of diagnosis at different ages in the reading.  We'll talk about it Friday.

Hi Gary,

We're thinking the DDx for AUB in different ages is beyond the level of M2s and also, they haven't had these diseases (cancers etc).  Can this activity be simplified?

Hi, guys.

Just a quick note on where we are at with the faculty guides and the session activities.

1.  Some general edits:

I need to check the dates in the headers of all of these guides.  I‚Äôll get that done ASAP.

We need to update the contact information for Microbiology.  Presumably this will be Nell and Paria but Paria hasn‚Äôt been officially hired.  I‚Äôll put Nell‚Äôs info in.

2.  Keith - Abnormal Uterine bleeding is basically done.   Mark Pool is going to find out how to create links to the virtual slides and embed them into the guide so that the students can get a good, high resolution look at them.  Other than that, it should be good to go.

3.  Carl - Pelvic inflammatory disease is almost done as well.  Gary has a minor edit for the women‚Äôs health activity where he‚Äôs going to make sure the students know what they need to take away from the tables in the answers.

4.  Keith - Infertility:  Anne is working a little bit on the clinical reasoning.  Jerry is going to design a pathology activity to replace the physiology activity from last year.  Frankly, this concept map wasn‚Äôt my best work and the students correctly pointed out that we need more pathology activities in this block.

5.  Keith - Teen pregnancy:  Anne is working a little bit on the clinical reasoning.  Other than that it looks pretty solid.

Fetal Death is the last case in this block and we‚Äôll talk about it next week.  The due date for Vital Fluids self-study materials is August 8 so we will likely move right into those guides on the 9th.

Thanks to all for your help.

This sounds like a good idea except that I have concerns about the ability of the students to get a differential based upon the self-study that we‚Äôve given them (or, more accurately, the lack of male information in the self-study the we‚Äôve given them).

I‚Äôd say this would be OK if you are careful about what you do.  They‚Äôre basically gong to have to be able to figure out the answers from what is in the pathology and genetics lessons, what the clinical educators tell them as they walk them through the clinical reasoning for the male vignette above your exercise, and common sense.

For the male infertility activity, there are possible causes in several organs and several types of disease.  It would not be easy for the students to derive a broad differential diagnosis from the histopathology self-study materials for this case.  This seems like a good opportunity to get the students to formulate a differential based on a pathogenetic classification.  Examples include infection, toxic exposures, metabolic/endocrine disorders, congenital malformations, and genetic abnormalities.  They may already be thinking this way but I don't think it's been emphasized.

Comments please...

Keith - Abnormal Uterine bleeding is very close.   Mark Pool still needs to find out how to create links to the virtual slides and embed them into the guide so that the students can get a good, high resolution look at them.  I believe he also still needs to embed images that are not marked up for the student guide.  Mark, can you please get this done ASAP?

**** DONE [#A] Keith - Infertility:  

Anne is working a little bit on the clinical reasoning.  Gary, can you please see the note from Anne under the ‚Äútesting‚Äù section of the clinical reasoning and work with her on finishing this up?

We made a slight alteration to Jerry‚Äôs new path activity.  Students will now be given some of the differentials which we felt were diseases that the students haven‚Äôt had yet.  I‚Äôve also added a note to the CEs to ask them to simply walk the students through part I of this exercise.  Jerry, are the last two images in part II supposed to be marked up in the student guide as well?  If not, we need non-marked up versions.

**** DONE Keith - Teen pregnancy:  Anne is altering the clinical reasoning.  Students will be asked to interpret the urinalysis and give next steps.

**** DONE Paola - Fetal Death is in remarkably good shape.  We didn‚Äôt think any of the exercises needed to be altered.  Anne is altering the clinical reasoning and for now the plan is to duplicate what we are planning for Teen Pregnancy.  Identify a test, ask for interpretation and identify next steps.  We didn‚Äôt settle on a test, however, and suggestions about what to do about this section are welcome.

Students are not able to be added to CourseArc. If you would like for them to do the activities you create in CourseArc, you would need to add a link to the CourseArc course that you created within your Blackboard course OR create a free Canvas course for students to access the material in CourseArc. My suggestion is to use Blackboard since this is the learning management system Rush currently uses and the registrar‚Äôs office creates the course and enrolls students. You can easily embed a link to your CourseArc course in Blackboard.  You wouldn‚Äôt need to enroll any students as you will for Canvas. Also, if you link CourseArc to Blackboard, any graded activities you create in CourseArc will integrate into the Blackboard Grade Center.
 
If you need any help with this or have any questions, please let me know and I would be more than happy to help.

Hi, guys.

Welcome back!  I wanted to send this out to give you guys a little heads up in terms of preparation for our sessions next week and there after.

There are a few things that will be different this year so I made a video both to highlight them and to introduce you to the block as a whole.  I think this block is a little unique as medical school courses go.  In a good way.  :) Please feel free to double time your way through the video:

https://youtu.be/yLrVNzNcL3Y

Slides:  

Powerpoint https://www.dropbox.com/s/d3eyvh8am8bffxf/S%26R%20Introductory%20Video%202019-08-19.pptx?dl=0
PDF https://www.dropbox.com/s/wc2oht324y65uux/S%26R%20Introductory%20Video%202019-08-19.pdf?dl=0

The plan of study for this block starts on 8/26.  The content for the first case is up and ready and we hope to get all content for the entire block posted by the end of the day Wednesday 8/21.  The first case is a double case and the BSci session is the day after Labor Day.  Feel free to get started on it early if you wish.

See you soon.

  I'll have a better idea how much time we need for video recording    I've been able to protect time here in June as I mentioned I would do in order to do this study guide revision, and ppt revision, and prep for re-recording the videos.

  Can you look at your schedule for halfdays that I have blocked off later in June for just for this recording -
  June 20th, Thursday in the AM and
  June 21st, Friday in the PM, and
  June 24th, Monday in the AM.

  I realize the old presumed deadline of June 30 has been moved unfortunately to the 26th, but videos will be the last thing that we will have to do.
