*** Concentric hypertrophy is exactly as you described it.  For cases like aortic stenosis, in response to the pressure overload, left ventricular wall thickness increases while the cavitary radius remains relatively unchanged.  These compensatory changes reduce the increase in wall tension observed in aortic stenosis.  See the wall thickness term in the Law of LaPlace. :aortic_stenosis:congestive_heart_failure:vital_fluids_and_gases:
In contrast, eccentric hypertrophy takes place in diseases like aortic regurgitation where there is a volume overload with very little change in systolic pressure.   Because systolic pressure remains relatively unchanged, increased wall stress—again by the Law of Laplace—can be compensated for by an additional increase in wall thickness but this time the ventricular volume increases.

This response is called “eccentric hypertrophy” because the ventricular cavity enlarges laterally in the chest and becomes eccentric to its normal position.  Patients with aortic insufficiency therefore have a different ventricular geometry observed versus those with aortic stenosis (concentric hypertrophy caused by the systolic pressure overload).
