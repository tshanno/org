** DONE [#A] Correct bug in org-sync :: Program generates duplicate IDs when syncing two entries in the same file
** DONE Bug in org-sync where if you sync from a branch the branch becomes the headline and the rest disappears
** DONE [#A] org-sync you need a delete entry function that will delete the SYNCID from the locations file. :: Actually I simply fix it so that if org-id find returns nil, nothing further will be done.

** DONE [#A] Bug where you get the "can't find ID nil" message  :: Actually I simply fix it so that if org-id find returns nil, nothing further will be done.

** TODO There is a bug where a branch that doesn't have an ID and is a TODO is a under a heading that does have an ID.  The cursor moes to the branch with the ID.  It messes up the agenda.
*** I removed org-trigger-hook and tried adding a org-todo advice function.  See if that works.
