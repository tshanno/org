It would be helpful to spend 10 minutes brainstorming about the new renal vignettes session.  Questions that I have for the group are:

1.  Essential hypertension: do any disciplines outside of pathophysiology have an activity they want to contribute/material they want to emphasize?  If not, pathophysiology can take over this vignette.

2.  Nephrolithiasis: what disciplines are contributing to this, and what should our activities be?

3.  Pharmacokinetics in CKD: this is primarily pharm - Mike please get started on your activities.

Anne,
They should get all the materials except the document with the answers.
 
Tom can post the video, PowerPoint and the cases. I do not mind them having the cases ( it is unlikely they will have gone through them) but I do want them to be told that they have to review the video and handout ( course notes) on Fluids and Electrolytes.
 
Best,
Syed

*** TODO [#A] Upload all of the materials.  Set a time to release the answers.

1.  Remake some food to fuel videos
2.  Remake some of the concept map activities that are lacking.  This might take the form of simply remaking the concept maps in Food to Fuel and/or finding a way to design these so that they are drag and drop.

M1 Students:
The Vital Fluids course has a mid-course exam, similar in length to the final exam.  This exam will be on Tuesday, November 26.  We are still finalizing the testing schedule for the day but I am writing now to let you know that half of the class is likely to be scheduled to take the exam from 3-7pm.  We are sorry for this but there is heavy use of the testing center and in order to make sure that you do not have to be here on Wednesday the 27th we felt that finishing the exam later on Tuesday was a better option.  We will follow up to let you know once the exam schedule for the day has been finalized.
 
Yours,
Bob
