It would be helpful to spend 10 minutes brainstorming about the new renal vignettes session.  Questions that I have for the group are:

1.  Essential hypertension: do any disciplines outside of pathophysiology have an activity they want to contribute/material they want to emphasize?  If not, pathophysiology can take over this vignette.

2.  Nephrolithiasis: what disciplines are contributing to this, and what should our activities be?

3.  Pharmacokinetics in CKD: this is primarily pharm - Mike please get started on your activities.
