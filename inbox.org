Hi, Xun.

Dan talked to me this morning and he said youâ€™d like a one month extension on his services.  He was supposed to go back to work with me in mid-September.  

I would therefore propose that we go ahead and have him work for you to the end of October.  This adds 6 weeks - two weeks of vacation that Dan plans to take during that time plus an extra 4 weeks of work.

That would leave us with this:

Xun: present - October 31
Tom:  November 1 - January 31
Continuing to alternate every two months after that.

Is that acceptable?

Thanks,
Tom S.
