** TODO Card for Ryan

** TODO Readme for physiology pdfs.

The files contain physiology readings that completely duplicate what is in your self-study guides.  The only difference is that they have not undergone some of the processing that the self-studies do.

If you are simply watching the videos and using the ntoes for reference, you probalby do not need these files.  To repeat, the content in these files is an exact duplicate of what is in your self-study guide.

If you are reading the notes instead of the videos, you may want to download these and see if they are more readable.  You may or may not prefer the formating in these files.  I'm simply giving you the option.

** Test
Hello all.

1.  Good luck on your HDHR summative exam today.

2.  Welcome to the Vital Fluids Block.  In a nutshell, this block covers the cardiovascular system and the renal system.  Once you have recovered from this exam you may want to double time your way through the following introductory video where I give an overview of the block and a few important details:

https://youtu.be/A9BgLTfI1I0

The slides are here:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/yd29mympmpp8stj/Vital%20Fluids%20Introductory%20Video%202019-10-01.pdf?dl=0

In order to get an idea of what is expected, I would strongly recommend that you watch this video tomorrow (Saturday) and not wait.  There is a fair bit of material and you probably will want to start studying Sunday for the first case.  Don't get me wrong.  Its manageable.  But catching up could be problematic if you fall behind.

Though this block is a step up in intensity compared to your first two blocks I think most of you will greatly enjoy it.  These are two of the most interesting and important organ systems in the body.  Frankly, I look forward all year to teaching this material and I am very much looking forward to interacting with you as we work through it together.

If there is anything you need or that I can do, let me know.
