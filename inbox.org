** TODO Post an announcement [[message://%3c8893ef4b938b40daacc03bf594263dc9@RUPW-EXCHMAIL02.rush.edu%3E][Genetic self study]]


I was just looking over the material and then received 2 emails from students.  The last question on the self-study is on microdeletions which we moved to another case.  Is there a way to put out a message to the students to ignore the last genetic self-study question?
