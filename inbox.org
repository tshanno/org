In 1995 Swatch broke the 125-year collaboration between Longines and Wittnauer and took over the Longines distribution.[3] The Wittnauer Company retained its reputation for most of the 20th century. After some budget problems, it was eventually bought by Bulova for $11.6 million in September 2001.[3]
Bulova launched a new 'Nightlife' range of fashion watches under the Wittnauer brand.
