** TODO Points for Bob about this [[message://%3c1571958689760.26358@rush.edu%3E][Today's Basic Science Session]]

*** This student is very high strung.  She emails me 2-3 times a day with questions.  She reminds me a lot of Melissa Prusky.

*** Putting the basic science session in the afternoon makes this a long day with the heaviest material on the back end.  Perhaps we should reconsider how we are scheduling this.

*** I dind't want to acknowledge it to the student but she has a point in that Syed's video on this content isn't great.  I've asked both him adn Mike Braderic to re-record videos that were done in the old lecture hall and they haven't done it.  I'm calling in Bob and Rahul next year.
** TODO Post an announcement to make sure everyone knows to finish the physiology before CIRCSIM on 10/31
