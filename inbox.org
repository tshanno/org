** Renin is released from granular cells in reponse to three stimulae:

1.  Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased renin release.  This is direct neural stimulation.

2.  Decreased blood pressure leads to increased renin release.  This is via detection by barroreceptors in the afferent arteriole

3.  Decreased renal tubular flow leads to increased renin release.  The decreased tubular flow is detected by the macula densa.  The macula densa cells release prostaglandins, which triggers granular cells to release renin into the bloodstream.
