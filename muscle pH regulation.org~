*** Abstract:  The complex membrane structure of the tubular system (t-system) in skeletal muscle fibers is open to the extra- cellular environment, which prevents measurements of H+ movement across its interface with the cytoplasm by conventional methods. Consequently, little is known about the t-system’s role in the regulation of cytoplasmic pH, which is different from extracellular pH. Here we describe a novel approach to measure H+-flux measure- ments across the t-system of fast-twitch fibers under different conditions. The approach involves loading the t-system of intact rat fast-twitch fibers with a strong pH buffer (20 mM HEPES) and pH-sensitive fluorescent probe (10 mM HPTS) before the t-system is sealed off. The pH changes in the t-system are then tracked by confocal microscopy after rapid changes in cytoplasmic ionic conditions. T-system sealing is achieved by removing the sarcolemma by microdissection (mechanical skinning), which causes the tubules to pinch off and seal tight. After this procedure, the t-system repolarizes to physiological levels and can be electrically stimulated when placed in K+-based solutions of cytosolic-like ionic composition. Using this approach, we show that the t-system of fast- twitch skeletal fibers displays amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange (NHE), which decreases markedly at alkaline cytosolic pH and has properties similar to that in mammalian cardiac myocytes. We observed mean values for NHE density and proton permeability coefficient of 339 pmol/m2 of t-system membrane and 158 μm/s, respec- tively. We conclude that the cytosolic pH in intact resting muscle can be quantitatively explained with respect to extracellular pH by assuming that these values apply to the t-system membrane and the sarcolemma.

***** "The eight-state ping-pong-type NHE model devel- oped by Cha et al. (2009) to fit a variety of NHE ex- perimental data in cardiac myocytes also fitted the predicted pH-dependence of the NHE-system activity in skeletal muscle remarkably well (Fig. 9 C)."
***** the proton dissociation constant on the modifier component for skeletal muscle was, however, only half that used for cardiac myocytes (14.8 vs. 30.3 nM). The NHE model of Cha et al. (2009) was adopted for the quantitative description of NHE activity under different cytosolic and luminal t-system conditions with respect to [Na+] and pH. A nominal factor f was introduced to adjust the exchanger’s turnover rate at different tem- peratures and different levels of phosphorylation.
**** it is known that hormones can alter the phos- phorylation state, which in turn modulates the transport activity of the NHE1 exchangers (Putney et al., 2002), and that NHE1 exchangers can be translocated to the plasma membrane (Lawrence et al., 2010)."

**** "The mean predicted NHE rate of proton removal across the t-system membrane of rat fibers at pHcyto 6.8 and 37°C (Eq. 12) is 161 nmol/m2/s. Assuming that this rate applies to the whole rat fiber surface (1,300 cm2/g; Clausen and Hansen, 1974), this translates to
∼1.26 mmol protons/kg/min. Because the proton ef- flux in muscle during exercise in rats in vivo is ∼6 times greater (7.6 mmol/min/kg; Kemp et al., 1992), it would be interesting to find out in future studies whether the t-system NHE transport activity is up-regulated by ex- ercise by altering the phosphorylation state of the ex- changer (Putney et al., 2002) and/or by translocation of new exchanger molecules (Lawrence et al., 2010) to the t-system membrane." - Kemp, G.J., C.H.

*** "Lactic acid accumulates in many intense fatiguing regi- mens and can lead to an intracellular acidosis of approximately 0.5 pH units. There are two major lines of evidence that have been used to link this decline of intracellular pH to the contractile dysfunction in fatigue. First, studies on human muscle fatigue of rapid onset have often shown a good temporal correlation between the decline of intracellular muscle pH and the reduction of force or power production. Second, studies on skinned skeletal muscle fibres have shown that acidification reduces the isometric force by a direct effect on the isolated myofibrillar proteins."  Fabiato A, Fabiato F.

*** "We therefore measured the intracellular pH in our mouse single fibre model of fatigue and found, to our initial surprise, that there was only a small acidosis of approximately 0.06 pH units (Fig. 1a). Later, we showed in the same preparation that if the duty cycle (the fraction of time the fibre is stimulated at 100 Hz) was increased, the muscles fatigued more rapidly and the acidosis was greater.5 We also found that blocking the lactate transporter with cinnamate substantially increased the magnitude of the resulting acidosis.6"
