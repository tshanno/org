  Talked to Gary.  He's open to calling the case "abnormal genital tract bleeding" and to making the patient younger.  He said that the students get the break down for likilihood of diagnosis at different ages in the reading.  We'll talk about it Friday.

Hi Gary,

We're thinking the DDx for AUB in different ages is beyond the level of M2s and also, they haven't had these diseases (cancers etc).  Can this activity be simplified?

Tom, Mark Pool, Christine Tsai, and I are all here discussing and are wondering what you think.

  This was OK.  Prostaglandin E2 is a dilator but prostacycln and thromboxane cause constriction.  These are prostaglandins, too, and on balance we get constriction.
