Hi, Dad.

The last day I need to be here in Chicago is Friday, 2/7/20.  I do need to be here in the afternoon but probably could fly out that evening if necessary.

Unfortunately, our schedule is not good. We MIGHT be able to do a cruise March 15-22, but won’t be sure until around the first of the year- it’s a school scheduling issue.  Unless there’s a great cruise during those dates that you want to go on (with or without us), go ahead and plan your own dates for February. We’ll see what happens for 2021.

One more restriction that I have.  I have a trip that I have to be in San Diego from Feb. 15-19.

Other than that, I could make the rest of February and March work.

Sorry,
Tom
