  Used to be Angela May?
  
  We went over Angela's test exam breakdown (not the exam which is, of course, off limits at this point since many questions are the same).  She did poorly in anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology.  I recommended active study techniques (image occlusion and Note cards) and that she review the old physiology exam questions.  I also sent her links to the updated computer programs online and asked for bug reports.

  Just a quick note on where we are at with the faculty guides and the session activities. I’m combining both the Sexuality and Reproduction report with Vital Fluids because we’re now using the meetings for both blocks.  We’d like to get these faculty guides finalized ASAP.
  
  Sexuality and Reproduction
  
  1.  Abnormal Uterine Bleeding and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease is up.  Infertility is ready to roll and Janice is formatting it.  Thank you for your time and effort.
  
  2.  Teen pregnancy - we have one little hang up with one of the activities.  I think this is a minor problem where I hope it's just that one of the Women’s Health activities will have to be slightly rephrased.  Gary, Anne, Keith and I will meet early next week to solve this issue since Gary couldn’t make it to the meeting.
  
  3.  Fetal Death - we also have a hang up with Activity 2 in this case as well as the clinical reasoning.  Activity 2 may have to be redesigned depending upon how Gary feels about it.  We will also talk about these topics with Gary early in the week.
  
  These two faculty guides have to be finalized this week.
  
  Vital Fluids
  
  1.  We took a look at the Tetralogy of Fallot case (the first one).  We decided that we need to encourage the faculty to move quickly through this case and we definitely need to make sure that the students get through the team circles on time.  We will add a note to this effect in the guide and I will talk to the team circles students.
  
  2.  I had one or two small notes to address next week and we’d like to talk to Kiya about this case at the next meeting if possible and make sure she is OK with what she sees.
  
  Thanks to all for your help.

Hi Tom,

Mark and I had the chance to sit and talk and we came out with an idea for an activity. will have 3 clinical scenarios for dilated, hypertrophic and restricted cardiomyopathy will have them matching it to pathology slides and if we can an echocardiogram. Let me know what do you think.

Hi, guys.

A quick update on what happened at the meeting yesterday for those who didn’t need to be there.

1.  Myocardial infarction 2 seems to be good to go.

2.  We reviewed heart failure session 1 -  Anne and Tom re-worked on the Pathophys activity to convert it from a table to a series of multiple choice questions that compare and contrast the types of heart failure.  This activity has now been copied into the guide and replaced the table that used to be there.  Anne is still making minor adjustments but I think everyone was reasonably happy with it.

3.  We started heart failure session 2

a.  We eliminated the activity which was oriented around salt intake in HF
b.  Anne is helping to re-work the nutrition self-study to bring it into compliance with current thinking on the matter.  She will communicate with Sarah.
c.  We will pick things up net week with activity 2 in this case where we are replacing the Professional activity from last year with a pathology activity from Mark and Paola and possibly Carl.

We got through valvular heart disease yesterday.  

The plan for next week is to back track and review the pathology activity that is being added to Keith Simmons Session 2 and to push ahead to the arrhythmia case and (hopefully) pre-renal dehydration.

We need to start moving briskly through these cases.  They all need to be up by Oct. 9.  That means we have just three of these meeting left to get through 5 cases, including the new renal vignettes case.  I may have to ask you guys to start reviewing content electronically if we don’t have to time to go over it person in our meetings.

	[[message://%3c39E9AD2A-5E6F-47D0-9E44-380AE549EB78@rush.edu%3E][Re: Cardio question]]

Hi, Max.

Sorry for the delay getting back to you.

You are definitely correct that the afterload decreases because of the reduced outflow resistance.  However, the chronic volume overload causes dilation of the ventricle.  This causes increased wall stress (due to the Law of LaPlace where wall stress increases with diameter).  Because the ventricular muscle has to contract against this increased stress and it has to be overcome to eject blood, the afterload is increased.

The effect is described here:

  This is a damned mess.  The last spreadsheet I saw had HF parts 1 & 2 and MI parts 1 & 2 lumped together in one case each.  It looks like she almost randomly assigned the topics to one part or the other.  There was no reanl vignettes case in that sheet either as it had just been added.
  
  I gave Jeffrey the rainbow sheet and he will suggest to Princess that these topics be switched around.  Unfortunately she is out of town so that won't happen until Monday.

There are several sessions that have no, or very few topics assigned to them. I’ve created folders and linked them according to what we currently have assigned. I’ll need to know asap so I can move/finalize folders, and move content from last year. I can send this out on your behalf for faculty to approve their topic locations. I’m sending an email for Dr. Al-Ghoul today as well.

Hi, guys

As most of you know, we completely tore apart the Vital Fluids exams this year in order to create a midterm along with a non-comprehensive final.  The midterm covers all of the cases through dehydration (Mark Ryfield).  We have finally gotten the blue print together for these exams:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cLhrYJKP8YEdLnDiyvSJUE_N6GKDdlygganoIj2gCSw/edit#gid=0

A few things to note:

1.  I intend to promise the students to go lightly on the Mark Ryfield case on the midterm because it is the only case that will be directly re-tested on the final exam.  It is the first and only renal case on the exam and it is the last case before the midterm so they won’t have much time to digest this material.  Please design your questions accordingly.

2.  Please note that the tab for the midterm replaces the second formative exam from last year for this block.  Michelle went ahead and left the questions from the midterm from last year on the sheet.  You are welcome to keep as many as you like as long as they are relevant (they should be).

3.  Please note that there are TWO SUMMATIVE TABS.  The one that we need to fill out is “Summative (19/20)".  The other one is from last year.  Please feel free to copy over any questions from last year’s exam to either the midterm or the summative as appropriate.

4.  We’d like to have this done by Monday the 26th.

Thanks,
Tom S.

*** YOu had a couple quesitons here tha tstudents could argue should have been on formative 1.  ONe was on compliance of the ventricle/veins the other was on things that are synonymous with preload.  Porbably thes should be replaced.
*** Tehre was another quesitons with an exercising person where you aksed what happens to flow thorugh AV anastomoses.  You need to put explicitly in the stem "in response to increased body heat".  Otehrwise students get confused with the vascular response to exercise.  You had to give credit for both A and B onthis question (assuming its going to be challenged).

** Fluids and electrolytes Workshop <2018-12-14 Fri>
*** Rahul filmed Anne's introduction to this workshop but I do wish that he had filmed her actually doing the it.  This may be worth doing.  
*** I read through the answer sheet and there are some real rough spots.  I read through the answer for the CHF case before I responded to a student email and Syed totally makes it sound like the vascular volumes are actually down not up.  Perhaps Anne can take a look at it next year and clean it up a bit.
