** Add an explanaiton to the concept map in CKD.  It implies joint pain is due to Ca loss from bone [[https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/mineral-bone-disorder][which it can be]].  But uric acid accumulation may contribute.

** DONE Revise CKD according to Anne's comment:  "Okay.  From a clinical perspective we do it the other way around.  Meaning thiazides are a first-line treatment for hypertension.  If needed add triamterene to mitigate low K.  We do NOT have people on triamterene first and then add a thiazide."

*** Turns out, both the loss of Ca and the urate can cause this.  Need to re-write the answer in CKD to explain this.

*** Some of the CEs are telling me the students struggled with the pathophys activity in the CKD case today.  The patient was diabetic and reuired dialysis.  We originally wrote it for the M2s.  I looked at it yesterday and didn’t think there was anything that we couldn’t reasonably expect them to learn.  But the general feeling was that the student sneeded more prep for it in the self-study.

Anne suggested changing the patient's diagnosis to hypertensive nephropathy leading to ESRD  since they've had HTN.
*** Ritu thought they needed something that spelled out the step by step approach to a CKD case in pathophys.
