** DONE [#A] Be sure to mention all three things that affect release of renin from granular cells.
I sensed confusion over this issue and so I wanted to post something to clarify it.  Renin is released from granular cells in reponse to three stimulae:

Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased renin release.  This is direct neural stimulation.
Decreased blood pressure leads to increased renin release.  This is via detection by barroreceptors in the afferent arteriole
Decreased renal tubular flow leads to increased renin release.  The decreased tubular flow is detected by the macula densa.  The macula densa cells release prostaglandins, which triggers granular cells to release renin into the bloodstream.
We really didn't emphasize #3 and I got some quesitons about it.  Hope this clarifies the issue.

Good luck,

Tom S.

If blood pressure drops too low due to excessive fluid loss, then the *sympathetic nervous system will override renal autoregulation*. Sympathetic nerves innervate the afferent arteriole, causing smooth muscle contraction. The sequence of events is as follows: loss of ECF volume (due to hemorrhage, diarrhea or dehydration) causes a drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Decreased MAP is detected by arterial baroreceptors, which leads to sympathetic nervous system activation, afferent arteriole constriction, and decreased GFR.

* Does Angiotensin II increase or decrease GFR?

I have been asked about this a couple times partly because of a misprint in my notes (Figure 6.13) and partly because Dr. Braderic has in his video that angiotensin can decrease GFR.

The physiology notes point out that angiotensin II constricts both the afferent and efferent arteriole but that the constriction of the efferent is predominant and increased renin secretion, for instance in response to a dropin blood pressure, results in an increase in GFR.  Pretty much every physiology text you will find and most of what you find elsewhee on the Internet describes the effect this way.

Having said that, Dr. Braderic pulled his information from Goodman and Gillman, which is a classic pharmacology textbook/reference.  G&G states:

"Normally, AngII slightly reduces GFR; however, with renal artery hypotension, the effects of AngII on the efferent arteriole predominate so that AngII increases GFR.‚Äù

My interpretation of this is that if you inject someone with normal pressure/high pressure with A-II, you get a slight decrease in GFR.  This may also have relevance if you are giving someome who has normal or high blood pressure an ACE inhibitor.  

However, under physiological conditions, A-II goes up when the blood pressure drops and when this is the case, the constriction of the efferent is predominant and GFR goes up.
