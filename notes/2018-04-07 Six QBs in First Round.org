\begin{quote}
  The 2018 NFL draft has four quarterbacks who are certain to go in the first round, in USC’s \textbf{Sam Darnold}, Wyoming’s \textbf{Josh Allen}, UCLA’s \textbf{Josh Rosen} and Oklahoma’s \textbf{Baker Mayfield}. Louisville’s \textbf{Lamar Jackson} appears likely to go in the first round as well, and Oklahoma State’s \textbf{Mason Rudolph} has visited with several teams in need of a quarterback and may find himself going in the first round as well.

That would match the record of six quarterbacks set in 1983, when \textbf{John Elway} went first overall to the Colts (and then was traded to the Broncos), \textbf{Todd Blackledge} went seventh to the Chiefs, \textbf{Jim Kelly} went 14th to the Bills, \textbf{Tony Eason} went 15th to the Patriots, \textbf{Ken O’Brien} went 24th to the Jets and \textbf{Dan Marino} went 27th to the Dolphins.

This same thought has occurred to me in reference to this year's draft.  This post finally spurred me to review the performance of those six quarterbacks just to see how they did.

Elway, Marino and Kelly, of course, were franchise quarterbacks.  Marino played 17 years and was a 9 time all-pro.  Elway played 16 years, also was a 9 time all-pro and won 2 Super Bowls.  Kelly spent his first 2 years with the Houston Gamblers but spend the next 11 with the Bills.  He was only a first team all-pro once but was in 5 Pro Bowls.

No question, these were franchise defining picks.  The other three...  not so much.

Note:  I'm abandoning this post.  The odds of being good in such a year aren't as low as I thought.
