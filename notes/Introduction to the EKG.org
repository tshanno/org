* Syed's EKG Introduction
** boxes
1 small box =  0.04 sec
1 large box = 0.20 sec
6 large boxes = 1.2 sec
** rate
*** 1 beat every 0.2 sec = 5 times per second = 300 bpm

*** 1 beat q 0.4 sec = 5 times q 2 sec = 150 bpm

*** 1 beat q 0.6 sec = 5 times q 3 sec = 100 bpm
*** 1 beat q 0.8 sec = 5 times q 4 sec = 75 bpm
*** 1 beat q 1 sec = 5 times q 5 sec = 60 bpm
** Intervals
*** PR interval 0.21-0.2 sec
*** QRS 0.6-0.1 sec
** Amplitude > 5 mm limb leads and > 10 mm precordial leads
** Small narrow Q waves may be normal in I, aVL, aVF, V5-V6
** Heart Block
*** 2nd degree type 1 - gradual increase in PR interval
*** type 2 - no gradual change - abrupt drop in QRS
** AV leads
*** AVR perpenticular to III
*** AVL perpenticular to II
*** AVF perpendicular to I
