**** he set the franchise record for completion percentage at 66.6.

**** General manager Ryan Pace made a concerted effort to overhaul the wide receiver corps last offseason and added to it again in April with the selection of Riley Ridley in the fourth round of the draft. Pace also has rebuilt the backfield with the signing of Mike Davis and selection of David Montgomery. The moves have surrounded Trubisky with more talent, raising expectations for the quarterback and the offense as a whole with more explosive results expected this season.

**** He’s confident in what he’s looking at. He’s not just trying to figure out what the play is. Now he gets to look up and look at the coverage. It’s just a drastic change from last year.

*** Not going to be the second healthiest team again

*** Almost the entire defensive staff left (except DL coach, check this)

*** Lost Adrian Amos and the Bryce Callahan

*** They won't get as many breaks this year.  Not as many things are going to go right.  They are going to face more adversity.

*** In addition to Trubisky, they need Adam Shaheen to come thorugh.

*** Will loss of Jordan Howard be significant?
**** Bears wanted a Kareem Hunt.
**** Miles Sanders went in the second.  Darrell Henderson  went two picks before Montgomery and I think the Bears traded up to get him becuase they felt they were running out of options.  Devin SIngletary went with the next pick
**** Notgomery is still a third rounder so I wouldn't get expectations too high but he and  Mike Davis are what they were looking for.  Nagy wanted a Kareem Hunt.  Pace and his scouts wanted someone who could make you miss in the hole.

*** Matt Nagy Hire

**** I’m not a big fan of automatically hiring the opposite of what you had before.

***** John Fox had his flaws and not all of his decisions were good ones - most notably the hiring 
of Dowell Loggains as offensive coordinator.  But he was experienced and he'd been around the 
league enough to know who to hire.

***** I'd have prefered someone who has made his mistakes in the past like *Josh McDaniels* or *Pat Surmur*.
Instead the bears have an an inexperienced 39 year old coach to go with an inexpeerienced 40 yer old GM.

**** Pace doing a lot of things that I've been tought that GMs shouldn't do.

***** 1st he fell in love with *Mitch Trubisky* and arguably traded away draft picks that he didn't need 
to trade away to get him.

***** Now he's rushing to hire a HC that he perceived as being someone that the Indianapolis Colts might want.

***** Did Pace rush this hire in order to get the right assistants on board?  Again, this is something that 
I've been told repeatedly that GMs shouldn't do.  You get the right guy, then worry about the staff.

**** Similarities to Rams

***** Having said that, the Bears are trying to follow this model.

***** Y)Oung QUARTERBACK-centric  coach - which is generally good

***** need their Wade Philips, young qb coach.  that would be Vic Fangio and they probably felt they 
needed to rush to keep him on board.  This would be a good thing and it would allow them to keep 
a highly regarded defensive staff largely intact.

**** As far as getitng a QUARTERBACK centric HC - Andy Benoit 
***** The Bears will run a highly schemed West Coast-style offense. 
It’s a great fit for Mitchell Trubisky, whose NFL success will 
hinge predominantly on timing and rhythm throws.
***** Trubisky isn’t quite a gunslinger, but with more consistent mechanics 
****** he can be a precision accuracy passer. 
****** Plus, he has excellent vision 
****** and body control when throwing on the move outside the pocket. Expect 
Nagy to make good use of this mobility for no other reason than that 
slower-developing play designs, like rollouts and bootlegs
****** I think ideally we're going to see a well-designed WC offence with a good, accurate passer running it.
