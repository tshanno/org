I agree with all of this.  Allen is a little old at 29.

2. The Dolphins’ signing of tight end Dwayne Allen says: (a) new offensive coordinator Chad O’Shea liked Allen in New England; (b) they’re not happy with blocking tight ends like fourth-round pick Durham Smythe or Nick O’Leary; c) they’re not going to ask Mike Gesicki to be an in-line blocker anymore. There’s also a larger question of whether a team that keeps getting accused of tanking would spend two years and $7 million on a role-playing tight end. Answer: They wouldn’t. Plus, if you’re tanking you say you are doing that like the Cleveland Browns and Philadephia 76ers did.

Why did the Eagles let him go?  Immature.

3. New England is up to its wily ways again by signing Michael Bennett for $7.5 million a year and, probably waving good-bye to Trey Flowers in free agency. Flowers is expected to get a deal of at least $15 million, perhaps from the Dolphins and former Patriots defensive coach Brian Flores. The Dolphins are interested, and I wrote about the possibility a few days ago. But that’s the game the Patriots play — finding cheaper talent of equal play (if not age. Bennett is 33, Flowers is 25)

See which players are on the move as the Miami Dolphins continue to revamp their roster in free agency.

(Keven Lerner, Kenny Rosarion)
Dorsett, a former St. Thomas Aquinas High star who was a standout receiver at the University of Miami, has caught 95 passes for 1,237 yards and six touchdowns in his first four seasons. He’s started four of the 32 games he played for the Patriots the past two seasons.

Hogan, a slot receiver the Dolphins had in training camp in 2012, has 194 receptions for 2,610 yards and 18 touchdowns in his seven NFL seasons.

Retaining Parker decreases the odds of Miami signing either player. But it’s possible that the Dolphins could add another receiver or two in the third wave of free agency, or the NFL draft in April.

Hogan is 30 years old. Neither of these guys were great options and by keeping Parker they increase the compensatory picks from the loss of James
** CANCELED [#C] [[https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-eric-rowe-20190313-story.html]] This looks like a reasonable signing. Rowe is only 26. They’re going to want to sink their money at the position into Howard.

It either becomes The Billy Turner Story told with a first-round pick whose career gets resuscitated with a new coaching staff.

Or — and here’s my guess — it’s proof that all the questions following Parker out of college don’t disappear after four NFL years. Injury issues. System issues. Role issues. It all led to just nine touchdowns in four years in which he often had a feature role — and just two touchdowns the past two years.

Goes with Parker point.

Omar Kelly and Dave Hyde \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/xs-and-omar/116466423-132.html}{discuss what they would need to see this year to be convinced that Josh Rosen is the quarterback of the future (at the 5:00 mark)}.

Kelly's initial answer was ``7 wins''.  :eye roll:  Hyde's more reasonable response was ``You'll know it when you see it''.

A couple things here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In fairness, Kelly immediately started to back off his ridiculous response.  Seven wins on a team with more holes than answers is absurd.  But it does show you what his attitude towards this situation is.  Despite \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-kelly-column-20190430-story.html}{claiming otherwise}, he's determined not to like the Rosen experiment.

  I'm not saying that I mind that.  Like every reporter, no matter who he is, Kelly is welcome to his opinion.  No reporters, no matter how hard they try, can completely suppress those opinions when they write their articles.  And Kelly isn't just acting as a beat reporter.  He's also a columnist where he is actually paid to express that opinion (whether beat reporters should also be allowed to be columnists is a topic for another day).

  Nevertheless, this is something that needs to be born in mind when you read his articles.  They're going to be biased and an informed reader is going to have to compensate mentally for that.
  
\item Neither of these guys is right.  The truth is, with the Dolphins roster constructed the way it is, no one on the outside is really going to know whether Rosen is the answer.  It's not going to be a good year.  Peyton Manning won 1 game his rookie season.  I think we can all agree he wasn't a bad quarterback.

  What people not directly associated with the team are going to have to do is have faith that the coaches know what they're dong and that they'll be able to properly evaluate Rosen from the inside.  They're the ones in the locker room.  They're watching the film.  They'll know how Rosen responds to coaching.  They'll know his strengths and weaknesses to some extent independent of the talent around him.

  We'll be convinced that Rosen is the answer when we find out whether the Dolphins take a quarterback high in the 2020 draft.  Until then, keeping an open mind is really all you can do.

Armando Salguero \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article229939589.html}{separates spin vs. fact about the Dolphins draft}:

\begin{quote}
  ``Narrative: The Dolphins trade down in the second round was part of Miami’s plan to land Rosen.

``Mando verdict: Not only is this spin, it is demonstrably untrue.

``We understand that from general manager Chris Grier himself. From the Dolphins’ news conference at the end of the draft Saturday:

``Question: Were there discussions at pick 48? Did you have to trade back from 48 to make that [Rosen] trade happen in your mind, to make the numbers add up?

``Answer: 'No. The Cardinals were steadfast in what they wanted for it and they were pretty up front with all of the teams. We hadn’t really talked to them until right at the start of the draft, and I think that’s when they started contacting everyone that might be involved. As we went through, we had talked throughout the day a little bit here and there and we finally got to a point where we were comfortable in making a pick. In terms of picking up, for us, it was huge to get the second-round pick in 2020, with the Saints when we made that trade. Regardless of what was there, we were going to make that trade to get the second-round pick. We went into the draft trying to find either another first or second-round pick in 2020.'

``In one-on-one phone interviews served up by the Dolphins media relations department for a couple of national writers, Grier told both Monday Morning quarterback and Football Morning in America that the two were not connected. And he told FMIA that reports of a deal with Arizona being done earlier that somehow guaranteed a trade for Rosen after Miami traded down were wrong.''
\end{quote}

Salguero makes a lot of good points in this article but that one falls flat.

Salguearo's point is that the Dolphins made the trade not knowing if they could swing a deal for Rosen with the 62nd overall pick or not.  No deal was in place.  I have absolutely no trouble believing that.

At the same time, Salguero, perhaps purposely, misses the point.  The fact that the Dolphins felt good making the trade even if Rosen didn't come with it doesn't mean that they didn't have a potential Rosen deal in mind when they made it.  In fact, given that they were already in discussions and thought the 48th pick was too high but obviously felt the 62nd wouldn't be, it would be foolish not to assume that they didn't.

Whether the Dolphins were willing to stand on this trade without a Rosen deal or not, the end result is the same.  They basically \href{https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/miami-dolphins-post-draft-points-of-view}{traded back into the third round and added a fourth round pick to make this happen}.  Intent aside, that was the end result of their maneuvering and that is the bottom line.

Any other conclusion is just spin.

The Sun-Sentinel does \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/sfl-star-nfl-qbs-whose-first-years-have-been-inferior-to-the-rest-of-their-careers-20190503-photogallery.html}{a photo gallery} of quarterbacks who, similar to new Dolphins quarterback Josh Rosen, had slow starts to their careers.  In one photo they highlighted the start of Peyton Manning's career:

\begin{quote}
  ``His first game was against the visiting Dolphins who grabbed three of his passes, including one for a pick-six by Terrell Buckley in a 24-15 Miami win. By the time the Colts had finished the first quarter of the season, Manning had piled up 11 pickoffs against only three touchdown passes. Things stabilized from there as he threw 23 touchdowns and 17 interceptions in the final 12 games. The rest is Hall of Fame history.''
\end{quote}

I hate clicking through these photo galleries and I usually don't bother with them.  But I knew I was going to have to read this one because I knew Manning would come up on a list of very good quarterbacks.  With all due respect to Tom Brady, Dan Marino and the many others you could mention, Manning is in my opinion the greatest quarterback in the history of the game.  I love all of those other guys but not one of them had to literally lift their team and carry them the way Manning did.

But that's not my point.  My point is that Manning elevated his game from his first \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Indianapolis_Colts_season}{3 win season} through to NFL history with the help of very good coaching from legendary offensive coordinator Jim Moore and quarterbacks coach Bruce Arians.  And Rosen is going to need that kind of help.

Like Manning, Rosen is smart.  In fact, \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/dave-hyde-blog/fl-sp-hyde5-jimmy-johnson-rosen-20190503-story.html}{in the words of former Dolphins head coach Jimmy Johnson}, probably too smart.

What did Johnson mean?

Rosen has a reputation for being arrogant.  Most Dolphins fans can't figure out where that reputation came from because \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-hyde-dolphins-rosen-20190429-story.html}{his introduction to the Miami media, as least, was nothing but positive}.  But I have an idea how Rosen might have gotten stuck with this label.

In my day job when I'm not bloviating about the NFL, I teach first year medical students.  Specifically, I deal with a lot of extremely intelligent, high achieving students that I greatly respect.  And those students challenge me by with a lot of questions.  In fact, even after doing this for going on 17 years, I'm constantly amazed at my students' ability to come up with things I've never heard before.

Sometimes these interactions test my limit when trying to show that I know what I'm talking about.  And, at least as important, they test my willingness to admit when I don't know what I'm talking about.  I enjoy these conversations, especially when the latter is true, because it forces me to learn something.  I'm nearly always better for having talked to a smart student about a topic.

But I have tell you honestly that not all of my colleagues feel the same.  There are some who believe that its their job to always show students that they are superior and they don't like interactions with students who, frankly, might be smarter, if less knowledgeable, than they are.  In the end, they explain their shortcomings to themselves by blaming the students.  Most feel that these students lack respect.

And that brings us back to Josh Rosen, who is by all accounts an extremely intelligent player.  And, let's be honest, his teachers haven't been the best.

After having had three offensive coordinators in college at UCLA, Rosen is going on his third offensive coordinator as he joins the Dolphins this season after only one year with the Cardinals.  Up until this point, \href{http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/288438/the-good-and-bad-of-josh-rosens-five-offensive-coordinators-in-four-years}{Rosen has had to deal with a carnival of coaches} including Mike McCoy, who was fired after week 7 last year, followed by Byron Leftwich, who was fired after the season.  

Someone with more cruelty in his blood than I have than me might have called it a "clown car".  

Nothing against the Cardinals staff but you don't go through coaches like that if you are good at what you are doing.

Bottom line, it would be no surprise to find that Rosen was smarter than his teachers.  And it would be no surprise to find that his teachers didn't react well to the situation.

So far it seems that Rosen has had the same benefits that Manning had in his first seasons with the Colts.  Let's hope that he finds a better home in South Florida with good instructors that he can respect and, just as important, who can respect him.

Omar Kelly at the Sun-Sentinel href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-sidebar-20190509-gpapecygtve4vnitzeveudpkne-story.html}{describes the defensive scheme} that the Dolphins plan to run:

\begin{quote}
``Miami’s coaches intend to run a hybrid scheme that incorporates both elements of a 4-3 and 3-4 front, and envision themselves playing with five defensive backs on the field at the same time, possibly as the team’s base defense.

``Charles Harris, the team’s 2017 first-round pick, doesn’t have a clear cut position. Is he a defensive end or a linebacker?

``Minkah Fitzpatrick, Miami’s 2018 first-round pick, doesn’t have a defined role. Will he be playing free safety, nickel cornerback, a cornerback on the boundary, or all of the above?''
\end{quote}

I think Kelly describes the forest well but he misses the point when it comes to the trees.  The players in this defense will be expected to do a lot of things but to say that they don't have ``a defined role'' really isn't true.  In fact, if the coaches do their jobs right, their role will be very clear cut and well-defined in any given situation.  That won't be - or at least it shouldn't be - the problem.

The problem comes in when you consider the talent of your players and whether they are capable of executing those well-defined roles.  In this case, new Dolphins defensive line coach Marion Hobby seems to understand the challenge.

  ``That’s where the awareness comes in,'' Hobby said.

  ``A coach used to always tell me if you trick the [defensive] ends and trick the free safety, you’re going to get a big play.  So those guys have to have some awareness to them. They have to play with their eyes and their feet. It’s hard. There are very few that can.''

  When you are playing a multiple 3-4, 4-3 scheme, to a certain extent you throw the old position definitions away.  But position definitions are still there.  They're just new.  The trick, just as it is in the old standard systems, is the same.  Getting guys who are capable of doing their jobs and getting them to the point where they can execute them is still the key to successful football.

Armando Salguero at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article230246299.html}{stumps for a Laremy Tunsil contract extension}:

\begin{quote}
``Look, Tunsil has not fully arrived. He’s not fully developed. There’s much room for growth. But no one in the Dolphins organization questions whether he should be part of the organization going forward. Because he’s very good.

``So, I’m told, there are plans to get Tunsil locked up long term also -- perhaps before the start of the regular season.''

``Paying now will ultimately be cheaper than paying later. Trust me, player salaries rarely go down. So signing Tunsil to an extension would be beneficial for 2020 and ‘21 cap purposes.''
\end{quote}

Salguero has a point.  But there are drawbacks.

As Salguero points out, the Dolphins don’t have to do this. Tunsil is under contract for 2019 and they have already picked up the fifth-year option for 2020.  If they had to, they could apply the franchise tag in 2021.

Interestingly, Omar Kelly at the Sun-Sentinel \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-xavien-howard-20190510-nmebckxrcnfnpfp2pamje77aeu-story.html}{asserts out in another article} that the Dolphins have been criticized for trying to do contract extensions too late.  He points to losses like defensive end Olivier Vernon, tight end Charles Clay, receiver Jarvis Landry, tailback Lamar Miller and offensive tackle Ja’Wuan James under Mike Tanenbaum.  I disagree with this assessment.  In each of these cases it wasn't a question of approching the player too late.  It was a quesiton of money and value where, right or wrong, the Dolphins in each case decided that there wasn't a match.

In fact, I would argue the opposite.  The Dolphins got themselves in some trouble after Adam Gase's first year by handing out a lot of contracts such as those for Andre Branch, Rashad Jones, and Kiko Alonzo that they'd probably like to get out from under.  In many cases, these players were extended when the Dolphins really didn't have to do it and they eventually let the team down either through disappointing play (debatably Alonzo), a lack of development (Branch) or poor football character (Jones).

Bottom line, a lot of money was spent that didn't have to be and probably wouldn't have been had the teams waited.

There are also some additional factors.  Players who get early long term deals tend to get comfortable.  This can lead to less concentration and a decline in quality of play.

And there is the fact that this sort of thing leads to the expectation on the part of other players that their contracts will be extended early, too.  So even if you aren't worried about extending Tunsil, the next guy who is more borderline will press for an early extension.  And when he doesn't get it, it can lead to an early hold out, one which agents have reason to expect might work simply because the team has a history of giving early extensions.

On balance, I'd say its better to wait until the 2020 offseason to extend Tunsil.  It would prevent Tunsil from having to enter a final, lame duck year and keep him out of the free agent market.  This while keeping the team from having to tag him and while setting a better pattern for other players under the new regime.  In the meantime, even if you are reasonably sure Tunsil is a part of your future, it gives you another year to make sure Tunsil remains healthy and to see how he develops and performs under the new coaching staff.

I think that would be what’s best for the team and best for the Miami Dolphins," Dolphins coach Brian Flores said.

Right.

This is, of course, what Flores has to say.  But this competition is - or had better be - slanted towards finding out what the young, potential franchise quarterback can do.  

It's absolutely true that you can't just trot Rosen out there no mattter what he does.  For one thing, evaluating Rosen isn't the coaching staff's only job.  Every young player on the team has to be examined and a determination has to be made about their future with the franchise.  That's particularly true of Kenyan Drake and Jakeem Grant, \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-xavien-howard-20190510-nmebckxrcnfnpfp2pamje77aeu-story.html}{both of whom are entering contract years}.

How can you evaluate your talent if the quarterback if the quarterback can't throw the ball accurately or run the offense?  How can you develop younger players?

So you do have to have a competant quarterback in order to develp and run the team properly in a rebuiding year.  But having said that if Fitzpatrick wins this job it will mean very bad things for Rosen.  And it will mean the decision about what to do come draft time in 2020 will have already been made.

Walton was cut by the Cincinnati Bengals last month after his third arrest.  He is facing felony charges for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon, marijuana possession and reckless driving. Significantly, the March 12 incident took place in Miami, his home town.  Now the Dolphins are not only giving him a second chance, they've brought him back to a city where old friends and bad influences could exacerbate the problem.

But that's not my point.  The problem is that they've brought him into a young locker room where veteran influence will have more than the usual impact on the development of the team.

I don't have a problem with Walton getting a second chance.  But giving it to him with the Dolphins seems like a very questionable move.

  ``I get it. Rome wasn’t built in a day. And neither were the Patriots. But this is simple roster management issue that could be fixed with a veteran addition, similar to how Jordan Mills’ signing potentially patches up the vacant right tackle spot.''
\end{quote}

Kelly is primarily concerned with the run defense but the problem will crop up when it comes to the pass rush as well.  The Dolphins are deficient at this position, the outside linebacker when they are in the base 3-4 and the defensive end in the nickel.  This position sets the edge against the run and pushes the passer.

There's no doubt about it.  The Dolphins have a huge roster hole at this spot.  But I'd love to know who Kelly thinks the team should sign as a ``simple roster addition''.  The truth is most teams are deficient in this area.  Anyone who is any good was taken off the market a long time ago.  Even if the DOlphins were willing to part with 2020 draft picks, most of those players aren't available via trade.

The Dolphins have evidently made the decision to let this position slide in a rebuilding year.  I don't like it, Kelly doesn't like it and you probably don't like it, either.  But I think its something everyone is going to have to live with because it's not a problem that will be solved until the next offseason now.

Adam Beasley at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins/article230302419.html}{thinks he understands} the Dolphins strategy in building the offensive line. 

\begin{quote}
``[Michael] Deiter checks all those boxes.

``Wisconsin’s do-everything offensive lineman started a ridiculous 54 straight games in college.

``And the Badgers are no finesse team.

``Wisconsin averaged 43.9 rushing attempts in 2018, compared to just 23.4 passing attempts.

``So while there were more talented options available to the Dolphins before taking Deiter in the third round two weeks back, there might not have been a better option.

``We’re going to be a tough, physical team,' [Dolphins head coach] Brian Flores said during rookie minicamp.

``The Dolphins drafted like it.''
\end{quote}

I think Beasley is right.  But I have a better explanation.

The Dolpins drafted Christian Wilkins, a defensive tackle, and Dieter, a guard, with thieir first two picks.  They are planning on being strong up the middle and building outward.  And that's a sound strategy.  Nothing disrupts the oppsing offense more than pressure up the middle.  Offensive guard is being recognized as an increasingly important position in the modern NFL as teams struggle to keep the pocket clean in front of the quarterback so that he can step up and throw.

\textbf{Omar Kelly} and \textbf{Safid Deen} from the Sun-Sentinel \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/dddc3139-323a-477a-84b2-550540d9d5e2-132.html}{discuss the development of the Dolphins defense} in this video (about the 2:35 mark).

There isn't much to say about it this early in the process but it is worth noting that installing a new defense and a new offense is going to be a particular challenge for this group of coaches.  The reason is simple - most of them haven't done it before.  Indeed, most of them have never even seen it done.

Many of the Dolphins coaches, both offensive and defensive, have spent their entire careers in New England, where head coach Bill Belichick is an institution and where the organization has been a smoothly running machine for a very long time.  Belichick probably doesn't even remember how he went about installing the Patriot defense from scratch, let alone his assistants.

The problem highlights one of the challenges that comes with being a Belichick disciple.  Many of these guys have never been anywhere else.

For instance, they've never developed the contacts in the league which can be necessary to succeed as coaches, particularly head coaches in Brian Flores's case.  So what happens when you have to hire assistants?  You look for former Patriots because you've never worked anywhere else and you don't really know anyone else.

Having veteran coaches like Jim Caldwell can help.  But that will only take you so far.  Flores and his staff have their work cut out for them in this respect.

Armando Salguero at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article230422099.html}{writes about the definition of leadership by Dolphins head coach Brian Flores}: 

\begin{quote}
``'If you work hard and put the team first, you’re a leader,' Flores said. 'I want to have 53 leaders on our team. I want 90 on our team right now. That’s something that you can develop. That’s something that you can talk about.'''

``Flores is right to point out that players on other teams might stay away and be leaders.''

``But everyone in that room Tuesday knew I was asking about the Dolphins. And [Rashad] Jones.

``Is he a leader on the Dolphins?''
\end{quote}

I'm glad that Salguero is pressing the issue of Rashad Jones absence from OTAs in a year where a new coaching staff is trying to install a new defensive scheme.  But that aside, I continue to be astounded that Jones is still a part of this team at all.

I understand that cutting Jones post-June 1 would entail \href{https://overthecap.com/salary-cap/miami-dolphins/}{eating \$17 million dollars in dead cap money}.  But the Dolphins have plenty of cap space.

How can you keep a guy who basically quit on your team by refusing to enter a game last year?  I don't care what issues Jones had with defensive coordinator Matt Burke or head coach Adam Gase.  As Flores, himself, correctly points out above, none of your 53 ``leaders'' should ever put pride ahead of the team, especially if you are a serving as veteran example.

I understand that football players aren't all going to be angels.  But right now the focus has to be first and foremost on developing young players and establishing a positive team culture.

Similar to \href{https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/running-back-mark-walton-gets-second-chance-with-miami-dolphins}{the signing troubled running back Mark Walton}, I can't imagine what \href{https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/points-of-view-from-a-dolphins-perspective}{a poor example} such ``veteran leadership'' will set for the youth on a rebuilding Dolphins team.

Every time Flores speaks to the team about ``putting the team first'', young eyes in that room will involuntarily turn to look at Jones (when he finally shows up).  I can't imagine the damage that will cause.
