\textbf{Adam Jahns} at \textit{The Athletic} emphasizes that fans \href{https://theathletic.com/1088301/2019/07/21/living-in-the-past-is-a-bears-tradition-but-the-2019-team-is-more-important-than-any-anniversary/?source=rss}{shouldn't let the 100 year anniversary of the Bears overshadow the importance of the 2019 version of the team making progress}.  He particularly emphasizes the importance of quarterback \textbf{Mitch Trubisky}'s continued progress:

\begin{quote}
“The word that comes to mind for me is incremental improvement, steady incremental improvement, and I think we’ve seen (Trubisky) do that,” [general manager \textbf{Ryan}] \textbf{Pace} said Sunday. “And as long as he just keeps on that pace, steady incremental improvement, we’ll be happy. You can feel his confidence growing; we’ve talked about that. Chemistry, continuity, all those things going into Year 2, and that’s going to continue as we go forward.”
\end{quote}

It is important to Note that this continued, steady improvement will be the biggest key to the 2019 season.  Trubisky is one of the most polarizing quarterbacks in the entire league right now.  YOu either really like him or your really, really don't.

Amongst my friends who root for other teams, most of whom are typical, I'd say 80\% will literally tell you that Trubisky is terrible and they don't understand the hype.  And there's good reason for their skepticism.

Even most objective Bears fans would have to admit that Trubisky was league average at best at the end of the year.  And that was, as Pace points out, after making steady progress throughout the 2018 campaign.  Its important to note that expecting anything beyond that is all extrapolation based upon the assumption that he's going to continue to progress

You to have had the opportunity to watch Trubisky make that steady progress last year, game after game, before you could actually get the feeling that he might be on his way to something special.  And what's going to be very interesting about this year is that it won't be just Bears fans who are going to see it.  Trubisky's progress is going to be a national story as the Bears are on national television six times, the maximum allowed.  

Until Trubisky actually shows that he's a very good quarterback,  he's just another guy.  If the Bears are going to remain competitive, he's going to have to become more than that.  Its far from a certainty that will happen.  But either way its going to be what we will all be watching for all over the league this year.
