\textbf{Brad Biggs} at the \textit{Chicago Tribune} \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-josh-sitton-contract-option-20180209-story.html}{reminds us that the window for the Bears to pick up their 2018 option on guard\textbf{Josh Sitton} begins Friday}.

Sitton is arguably the Bears most consistent offensive lineman but
he's going to be 32 next season and missed 3 games last year with
injuries.  The option is for \$8 million and his dead cap number is
only \$666,667.

In my opinion it would be a mistake to fail to pick up this option.  Not
doing so creates another hole in the lineup on a team that already has
a lot of holes to fill.

Many fans would like to see the Bears spend their first round pick on
former Notre Dame guard \textbf{Quenton Nelson}, who might be the best
player in the draft.  However, its hard to justify not using that pick
to fill an existing need.  Its also no guarantee that Nelson will be
there for them at the 8th overall pick.

The only way I see this happening is if the Bears sign Sitton, draft
Nelson, then trade Sitton for another pick in the draft.  It seems
unlikely that they could pull that off and it wouldn't be a great way
to treat a veteran player.  The Bears have typically avoided those
sorts of moves.
