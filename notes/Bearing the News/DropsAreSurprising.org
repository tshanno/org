  I’ve expected more out of the short screen game to get \textbf{Tarik Cohen} in space. Seems every other team runs it more effectively. Is that true? — @fols54 from Twitter

  That’s a keen observation on your part. I don’t know if I would say
  every team has a better screen game than the Bears, but it is fair
  to say the screen game has considerable room for improvement. In my
  estimation, it’s not a play \textbf{Mitch Trubisky} has executed
  really well to this point. Keep in mind it takes time to develop the
  feel, touch and most importantly the timing to be really good in the
  screen game. There are a lot of moving parts there with the linemen
  attempting to deke the defensive linemen and then getting out in
  space to clear a path. Cohen, obviously, has the skills to be really
  good in this area, but keep in mind opponents are being very careful
  with how they defend him. \textbf{Jordan Howard} continues to struggle
  catching the ball and really that has been a team-wide issue. The
  Bears have dropped 8.9 percent of catchable passes, the second-worst
  rate in the NFL behind only the 49ers (9.2 percent), according to
  STATS. Hopefully the Bears can iron out some of the timing issues
  with the screen game in the two months ahead.

  I actually have a couple points to make about this answer.

  Cohen could be very good in the screen play but we've seen the league rapidly adjust to him and I think there's some reason to doubt his long-term viability in the league.  Cohen practically made a living cutting back in his runs but once defenses understood what he was doing, they started taking those cuts away.  The result hasn't been good.

  The Bears desperation to find a receiver has led them to split Cohen out and he's done a decent job.  But he's awfully small and Trubisky has been struggling a bit with his accuracy.  That's not a good combination.

  How Cohen adjusts to the defenses is going to be one of the more interesting stories in the second half of the season.

  Here's hoping executing in the screen game is the answer to Cohen.  If there's one lesson that I learned watching the Saints, its how important that can be to an offense.  The Saints played off of their success in the screen game about as well as anyone I've ever seen and the Bears could use it just as effectively if they get their act together on it.

  The second point has to do with the drops.  I was really surprised by this statistic but I probably really shouldn't have been.

  I've noted a number of times during my quick game comments that drops haven't been a big factor in the games.  However, as Biggs statistic emphasizes, this is because they've thrown so few passes.

  The passing game is a lot like the running game in that it goes better when you build momentum.  Pass catchers that never see passes all game have a bad habit of dropping the ones that come to them simply because its such a long time since they've seen one.

  This argument is admittedly somewhat circular.  You never throw because you don't have success doing it.  You don't have success doing it because you never throw.

  I don't know what the answer is but I do know that the Bears need to break out of this.  Teams have zero respect for their receivers, sometimes crashing 9 men into the line of scrimmage.

  They aren't going to compete with many good teams without a passing game.
