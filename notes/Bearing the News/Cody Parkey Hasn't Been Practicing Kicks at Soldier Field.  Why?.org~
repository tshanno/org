Nagy understood the fans’ disgruntlement but said after the game there’s “zero chance” the Bears will try out new kickers this week. He insisted Parkey has his trust.

“It doesn't affect me going forward, but it affected me today,” Nagy said. “And he knew that. In my head, there's a balance of showing trust to him by putting him back out there, but then there's also a level of understanding what’s best for the team. Sometimes you just have those days.

“So my trust is not shot at all with him. I know everybody else is going to feel that way, and I get it and that’s OK. But … he’s going to hit some big kicks for us just like he did last week.”
