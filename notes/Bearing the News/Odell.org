``I was a little surprised by the number of folks that had the very
same question. There is zero possibility the Bears will trade the
No. 8 pick in the draft to the Giants for Beckham. Let’s be real
here. Beckham wants a new contract and it’s been floated that he will
seek a deal that approaches the range of quarterback money — think
\$20 million per season. The Bears are not going to fork over a
first-round pick, the kind of thing that would give them control of
the player for four seasons with a club option for a fifth year to
acquire a guy that they would then have to sign to a massive contract.

``Let me put this further in perspective. The No. 8 pick a year ago,
Panthers running back \textbf{Christian McCaffrey}, got a contract worth
\$17.24 million for four years. That will bump up a bit this year and
will still be less than \$20 million for one season. The nature of
Twitter is for folks to jump on the marquee names and play
connect-the-dots but there’s just no way this is happening especially
with the large investments the team has made in the position already
this offseason. Have we already forgotten about \textbf{Allen Robinson} and
\textbf{Taylor Gabriel} not to mention pass-catching tight end \textbf{Trey Burton}?

First let me say up front that I agree with everything Biggs said.

Having said that, from a fan's point of view Beckham makes more sense.  Fans don't care a lot about the money except as it affects the salary cap.  By all accounts the Bears still have plenty of room and Biggs himself has said many times that you can always create more.  It isn't a big barrier.  Cash budget is more important nowadays.

Given that is the case would you rather have Beckham, the best receiver in the game, or McCaffrey, a pretty good running back but hardly what I'd have called a difference maker last year?

The biggest problem I have with Beckham is his attitude.  He's one of the most entitled and immature players in the league and it leads to problems both on the field and off.  Those problems are a bit overblown in New York.  But still, the fact remains that you're talking about committing to a guy who is a huge challenge to coach.  So you really want to stick him with \textbf{Matt Nagy}?

It looks like a potential \textbf{Marc Trestman}-\textbf{Martellus Bennett} relationship if I ever saw one.

  the other day} about a question posed to former GM \textbf{Charley
  Casserly} was asked about the Dolphins move for a better “culture.”
Casserly said, “Don’t sacrifice talent for character.”  I tend to
agree.  But Beckham's a bad fit for the Bears right now.
