\textbf{Offense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Packers did the smart thing and stacked the line of
  scrimmage as everyone has before them.  The Bears tried to loosen up
  the Packers by passing a bit more on first and second downs,
  something new for them, rather than just running into the teeth of
  the defense every time.  They had limited success but I think this is
  what they have to eventually do if they want to be consistently
  successful.
\item One thing became evident early.  Either offensive coordinator
  Dowell Loggains or, more likely, Mitch Trubisky likes passing over
  the middle.  That might be just where Trubisky is seeing the
  receivers the best.  I think the Packers figured that out and
  concentrated on taking it away as the game progressed.
\item Adam Shaheen came alive and had some nice catches.
\item Trubisky is still struggling with his accuracy.  Easy passes are being overthrown.  This has been far and away the most disappointing part of his game.
\item Nice to see the screen play make a successful appearance for the
  Bears in the second quarter on a long run by Benny Cunningham.  They
  need to do more of that.  Of course, some success in other areas of
  the passing game would help with that.
\item Dontrelle Inman brought a little life today.  He's not a great
  revciever but he's as good as anyone the Bears have.

\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Defense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Packers didn't do anything special here.  It was mostly dink and
  dunk down the field all day.  The Bears were just a step slow all
  over the field.
\item There were a lot of missed tackles out there today in a sloppy game.
\item I think the Packers went at Kyle Fuller so often becasue he
  takes so many chances recently.  He goes for the big play but its
  risky.  If he misses there is often an awful lot of green behind
  him.
\item The Packers went with a hard count on 4th and 1 from their own
  29 at the end of the first quarter and no one in the stadium, fell
  for it.  Hundley wasted a time out on the play to prevent delay of
  game.  That was a poor decision.
\item The Bears had a lot of success blitzing Hundley, paritcularly
  where he was responsible for recognizing it himself and adjusting.
  It's quite evident that although its hs third year in the NFL, he's
  basically a rookie.  He made some poor decisions.
\end{enumerate}



\textbf{Miscellaneous}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Thom Brennaman and Chris Spielman were your announcers and man,
  Spielman did not impress me.  He added very little to the broadcast and sometimes seemed to reverse his opinions mid-explanation.
\item Both teams had a lot of success kicking field goals on a rainy day.
  
\item Cody Whitehair had a holding penalty on the Bears first set of
  downs.  There were two false starts in a row on the second set of
  downs.  The Bears had four penalties before Green Bay had thier
  first one.  The Bears took an offside at the end of the first half
  that moved them back a crucial 5 yards as they tried to play for a
  field goal.

  It was typical of the day.  Time after time the Bears
  shot themselves in the foot with penalties all day in a sloppy
  effort.  It didn't help that the game was poorly officiated.
  
\item Tarik Cohen showed some shaky hands early juggling the first
  pass to him and flat out dropped a perfect ball on the second.  Josh
  Bellamy had a bad drop near the end of the third quarter.
\item Its a shame that Cunningham's nice run on the screen play near
  the end of the first half was called a touchback upon review due to
  one of the worst rules the NFL has.
\item This was a miserable game for most of the afternoon.  Neither
  team really played well and the Bears in particular were flat and
  sloppy coming off of the break.  Too many penalties and they lost
  the turnover battle, albeit on a crummy NFL rule.

  With Brett Hundley at quarterback, the Bears blew an opportunity
  here.  They were just a step slow all day and they aren't good
  enough to beat anyone unless they're on top of their game.
