"As the Bears look to extend a five-game winning streak this weekend, their new challenge is staying sharp in the face of mounting success and praise.

“For a while people were saying that we weren’t a very good football team,” defensive end Akiem Hicks said. “And now on this side you have people hopping on the bandwagon and saying, ‘Oh, man, I’ve been a Bears fan since I was 12.’ It’s awesome. And there are people who have been riding with us through the whole thing.

“You have to remember what got you here. You have to remember the work and the time that you invested to get to this point. And I guess why stop now? Why stop now? When you’re on the top of the division, why pull back?”"
