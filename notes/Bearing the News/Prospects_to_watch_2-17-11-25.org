  \item undisciplined, always looks like he's rushing the QUARTERBACK, even against the run.
  \item collapses in and leaves the edge open.
  \item Goes inside on passing downs
    \item Looked like he was supposed to cover the tight end on the
    second Michigan touchdown.  He fell down but it was interesting
