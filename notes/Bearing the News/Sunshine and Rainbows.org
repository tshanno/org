\textbf{Rich Campbell} at the \textit{Chicago Tribune} \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-ryan-pace-matt-nagy-collaboration-20180331-story.html}{hypes the tight working relationship between new head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy} and general manager \textbf{Ryan Pace}}:

\begin{quote}
``More than a few times this offseason, the GM has dropped an index card on the coach’s desk, detailing a player about whom Pace covets Nagy’s opinion.

“'I can pick up phone and call Matt at 3 in the morning, and he’s going to answer on the first ring, and right away we’re talking football,' Pace said. 'I just appreciate his drive and his dedication to get this going. We share that, and it’s a fun time to be together.'”

Pace’s determination to be collaborative in shaping the roster under their shared vision “means the world,” Nagy said.

“'That partnership that Ryan and I talk about … extended into our coaches and scouts. When you have those two departments working together, you end up getting what you want in free agency.'”

I hate this time of year.  I really do.  Especially with a new head coach.

It's all sunshine and rainbows being blown up your posterior and all kinds of comments about how its all completely different now and everyone is so close and they're all on the same page.  Just like it was with \textbf{John Fox}.  And \textbf{Marc Trestman}.  And \textbf{Lovie Smith}...  Like we've never heard all this before or the lack of sustained success over the last 25 years doesn't still serve as a potential harbinger of things to come.

To be clear, I don't blame Campbell or any of his peers for this.  It's not fair to start hammering on a new regime before the new guy has even coached his first game.  He knows as well as I do that Nagy has a half a season of calling plays and no head coaching experience under his belt.  He's never even installed an offense before.

Campbell (and everyone else) is doing what he has to do.  And even a cynic like me can see that the team has gotten more talented in the offseason.  Well, potentially more talented, anyway.  As in the new tight end is a total projection and the new \#1 wide receiver has had one really good year three years ago and may or may not be totally healthy coming off of a devastating knee injury.

But hey, there's plenty of time to talk about that and similar problems over the next three years.  No reason to be in a hurry to start being realistic now.

I'm just tired of it.  I'd rather read nothing at all than deal with the hand holding and the kumbayas.  And perhaps that's what I'll do.
