\item \textbf{Brad Biggs} at the \textit{Chicago Tribune} \href{https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-kyle-fuller-season-review-cornerbacks-20190131-story.html}{reviews the cornerback position} as the Bears enter the off-season:


\begin{quote}
"[\textbf{Prince}] \textbf{Amukamara} set a bold goal of 10 interceptions before the season, and while that didnâ€™t happen, he played with confidence after going through a contract season each of the previous three years. Having some security allowed him to just go out and play. He had a pick-six in the Week 2 victory over the Seahawks and added interceptions against the Lions and Rams. Amukamara had 66 tackles to lead the position and three tackles for a loss with two forced fumbles. The passer rating against him was 82.9, and he tied for 19th in the NFL with 83 targets, per PFF."
\end{quote}

Amukamara had a good year but I fear that he was exposed a little bit in the last few games.  He \href{http://www.nflpenalties.com/team/chicago-bears?year=2018&view=log}{had 7 pass interference or defensive holding calls against him}.  All came in the second half of the season including one playoff game.  Three came in the last two games against the Vikings and the Eagles.

Having just signed a 3 year contract last offseason with \$18 million guaranteed, Amukamara isn't going anywhere but the Bears have to be at least a little worried that teams were trying to take advantage of Amukamara more as the season wore on and as teams adjusted to what they had going on defense.  Add the fact that they might seek a replacement for \textbf{Bryce Callahan} at nickel cornerback rather than investi ignificantly more cap space into the position and this is one of the few areas of uncertainty for the Bears this offseason.  It will be interesting to see what general manager \textbf{Ryan Pace} decides to do at the position.
