  "\textbf{Kendall Wright} was the Bears’ leading receiver in 2017. He
  was often double-teamed due to the lack of other credible Wide Receiver
  threats. Given that he had a relatively inexpensive contract and had
  synergy with \textbf{Mitch Trubisky}, why has he not been re-signed as a
  depth or insurance for \textbf{Kevin White}? Is there a detail or back story
  that I'm missing as his salary was a rounding error compared to the
  new contracts? — David D., Parts Unknown

  ``Wright was productive for the Bears in the final month of the
  season but let’s not overstate the value he brought to what was a
  really challenged offensive unit. I’d disagree with your assessment
  that he was often double-teamed. Wright is an average slot receiver
  at this point and the Bears have candidates that they believe will
  be more productive in the new scheme — \textbf{Taylor Gabriel} and
  \textbf{Trey Burton}. The Chiefs brought Wright in for a visit last
  week and it will be interesting to see if he generates a little more
  interest from the market. The Bears should be credited with some
  nice moves to overhaul and upgrade the position.''

Wright \href{http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kendall-wright-jumps-from-bears-to-vikings/}{signed with the Vikings} after this was written.

Like Biggs, I was curious to see what the interest was going to be for
Wright around the league.  Wright had success under former Bears
offensive coordinator \textbf{Dowell Loggains} with the Titans in
2013.  After that, he had more trouble.  His last offensive
coordinator there, \textbf{Terry Robiskie},
\href{http://bearingthenews.com/blog/2017/03/12/bears-will-give-wright-freedom-succeed-enough-rope-hang/}{was
  particularly blunt} about Wright's tendency to ``freelance''.

\begin{quote}
  “We’ve got 11 guys that are going to be on the field,” Robiskie said. “We’ve got 11 guys that we say, `This is your job and here is your responsibility,’ and I think Kendall is like everybody else — realizing those other 10 guys are counting on Kendall to be where he’s supposed to be and do what he’s supposed to do.”
\end{quote}

Perhaps Wright found a home in Minnesota where they will let him do what Loggains apparently allowed him to do.  But evidently, like Robiskie, new Bears head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy} is of a different sort.
