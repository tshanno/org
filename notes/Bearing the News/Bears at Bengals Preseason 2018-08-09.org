* Players to watch
** Trubisky looked fine.  Everyone else was pretty disappointing.
** Kevin White 11
*** Had a bad drop on 3rd and 10.  Roughing gave them the first but it was ugly.
** Anthony Miller 17
** James Daniels - played second team center and looked OK.
** Adam Shaheen - made some catches on thorws from Chase Daniel.
** Jonathon Bullard
** Roy Robertson-Harris
** Tanner Gentry 19
** Javon Wims
** Jordan Morgan 67 
** Isaiah Irving
** Kylie Fitts
** Leonard Floyd looked good.  He was beating the Bengals tackles one-on-one in a way that he wasn't doing before.
** Marcus Cooper looked awful.  In a game where people aren't supposed to game plan.  Cincinnati actually attacked him.

* Fullback
** Burton was in with the first team on 3rd and 10 on the first series.

* Geno Atkins was a force.  The Bears were obviously having a tough time handling him.
* There were a lot of drops.  At least 3 at 7:18 in the second quarter.  White, Javon Wims.
