\textbf{Offense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Lions came out stacking the line of scrimmage just like
  everyone else.  The Bears responded by throwing the ball more,
  apparently deciding that they could actually beat the Lions defensive
  backs.  They also threw some Mitchell Trubisky runs in.  All
  of this combined to loosen the defense up and the Bear sustained a
  drive down to the 5 yard line before settling for a field goal.
\item It didn't help the Lions that they struggled to get a pass rush
  on Trubisky early.
\item I thought it was interesting that the Bears chose to pass on
  that first possession in the red zone.  I noticed the first thing
  they did when they got down there again was run Jordan Howard before
  throwing for the touchdown to Adam Shaheen.
\item Shaheen had a breakout game as Trubisky hit him on some pin
  point passes in tight coverage.
\item Shaheen had such a good game in part because the Bears
  apparently decided to target the tight ends this game.  He and Brown
  certainly started hot with 3 catches for 36 yards and a touchdown.
\item It looked like the Bears made a concerted effort to get Tarik
  Cohen on the field more this game after taking heavy criticism in
  the media last week for not playing him more.
\item Second week in a row that we've seen the Bears run a good screen
  play.  That's encouraging.
\item Kudos to the Bears offensive line as they dominated the line of
  scrimmage early in this game.  Trubisky showed what he could do when
  he gets protection.  Unfortunatley things weren't so rosy in the second and third quarters.
\item Jordan Howard had a pretty good game as he ent over 100 yards.
  The Bears seemed to find the running game a bit in the fourth
  quarter after stalling for most of two quarters before that.

\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Defense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Not a fast start for the Lions as they just didn't execute well
  early on.  Stafford was a little inconsistent and fumbled the ball
  away on their first possession.  You have to wonder if they didn't
  take the Bears a little lightly.  They got thier feet under them in
  the second quarter.
\item The Bears did a reasonable job of getting pressure on Stafford
  as that Lions offensive line initially didn't look a lot better than
  it did last year to my eye.  Like everything about the offense,
  they did a better job starting late in the first half.
\item The Bears mixed coverages quite a bit and they weren't always in
  that cover two that they like so much.  The Lions did a pretty good
  job of finding holes in the coverage for big gains when they finally
  started moving the ball.  Looks like the Lions definitely know how
  to beat zone defenses.  It served them well today.
\item Marcus Cooper didn't do his chances of continuing to play a lot
  of good when he let Marvin Jones run around him like he was an
  orange traffic cone on the Lions second touchdown late in the first
  half.

\end{enumerate}



\textbf{Miscellaneous}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Thom Brennaman and Chris Spielman were your announcers.
  Spielman threw in some good points this week after a down
  performance last week.

  For example, he had an interesting tidbit about Trubisky calling out
  the blocking assignments at the line of scrimmage on a successful run
  that I thought was pretty good.  Later he caught Stafford yelling
  ``opposite'' as he told the offense which direction to run the ball.
  Spielman also made a good point when he showed that the Bears were
  double teaming Theo Riddick.  Its rare to double a running back out
  of the backfield.
  
\item Both special teams untis played well, I thought, until onnor Barth missed the potential game tying field goal by a mile.
\item Kyle Log got an unnecessary roughness on a rather stupid late
  hit.  Prince Amukamara had a bad pass interference [enalty that cost
  the Bears about 30 yards.  Both teams had damaging penalties.
\item Drops weren't excessive but Kenny Galloway had a huge one with
  less than 2 minutes lef tin the game that took 10 valuable yards
  away from the Lions as they were trying to get within easy field
  goal range. It also stopped the clock.  It essentiall force a 52
  yard attempt by Matt Prater to win the game.
\item Akiem Hicks recovered a Stafford fumble on the Lions first
  possession.  Nick Kwiatkoski knocked it loose.  The Bears converted
  it into a touchdown.  D.J. Hayden picked up a a bad snap for the
  Lions and scored a touchdown as the Bears gave the points from the
  Kwiatkoski recovery right back [eye roll].
\item The Bears lost Leonard Floyd to injury and almost lost Kyle
  Fuller but neither would have been bigger than the loss of Eddie
  Goldman.  The Bears weren't the same last year after Goldman went
  down.  I was glad to see him go back in.
\item Tweet of the day:
\begin{quote}
   BradBiggs:
  Since #Bears went ahead 17-7, they have run 13 offensive plays.
\end{quote}

That was late in the third quarter.
The Bears went dead in this game in the middle and couldn't sustain
what they started.  They found their legs again for a bit in the
fourth quarter but it was too little too late as the defense gave up a
very long, time consuming drive that ended in a Lions field goal.

The Bears showed some potential this game as they opened up the
offense.  They might have beaten a team like the Lions on an off day.
But the Lions were the better team and generally played like it.

Bears fans will just have to be patient.
