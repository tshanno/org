\textbf{Defense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Vikings came out and went right at Stefon Diggs matched up on Prince Amukamara.  It was obvious that was a match up they were going to like.  The Lions picked on Amukamara a bit last week.
\item The Vikings were also attacking Kyle Fuller, trying to take advantage of his agressivemness with double moves.
\item The Vikings were also trying a lot of trap plays in the running game, again taking advantage of the Bears aggressiveness.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Offense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item It seems that the Bears thought they could attack the Vikings offense on the ground to the outside on the right side.  They stacked their tight ends ot that side and ran quite a bit there.
\item The Vikings had a good game lan very similar to the Green Bay game plan the first game of the year.  They blitzed the Bears offense from a lot of angles as often as possible and mixed their defensive looks.  To my eye, the Bears handled it much better thanthey did against the Packers - as they should have, given 9 games in head coach MAtt Nagy's offense.
\item Mitch Trubisky needed to be patient tonight.  Teh Vikings were giving up the underneath throws and covering the deep routes to Gabriel, challenging them to play istake-free football and work their way down the field.
\item The Vikings spent a lot of time in what looked like a two deep zone.  The Bears were having a hard time early solving it and, as you might expect from the Vikings, they got a fair bit of pressure on Trubisky.
\item NOt entirely sure why the bears went for two on their first touchdown.  The situation didn't ordinarily call for it.  I can only assume that they had a play that they liked.  And it worked.  A nice throw to Anthony Miller in the back of the end zone.
\item I was impressed by the concerted effort the Bears put into running the ball this game.  They haven't done it well the last few weeks but they're working at it and they were better tonight.
\end{enumerate}



\textbf{Miscellaneous}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth, and Michele Tafoya were your announcers.  I've said many times that this is the best announcing team in football.
  
\item Special teams
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Cody Parkey hit his first field goal right down central which was good to see after last week's adventure when he missed four kicks.
  \item Of course, he followed that up by kicking the ball off out of bounds giving the Vikings great field position.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Penalties
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Kyle Fuler had a pass interference call in the first quarter.  It gave the Vikings a first down on third and three.  Eventually the Vikings Dalvin Cook fumbled deep in Bears territory, liimiting the damage.
  \item A holding call on Ben Braunicker in the first quarter pushed the Bears back from the Vikiking 8 to the 18.  The Bears scored the touchdown anyway.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Drops 
\item Turnovers
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Khalil Mack forced a huge Dalvin Cook fumble in the first quarter.  The Vikings were driving deep into Chicago territory and the turnover saved at least 3 points and very likely 7.
  \item Mitch Trubisky threw an interception and gave the ball back shortly after the fumble recovery.  He threw into what looked like triple coverage.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Summary
