\begin{quote}
\textbf{Christian Kirk}, \textbf{Calvin Ridley}, \textbf{Courtland Sutton}, who do you like? Are
any of them worth the eighth pick? Will they still be there in the second round? Can the Bears afford not to use the eighth pick on a Wide Receiver given there are no free agents worth talking about? — William K., Line of scrimmage Angeles, from email

``It’s still early in the process for evaluating players and how they
will wind up being slotted in the draft, but the consensus of most of
the folks I have chatted with, and this is going back to last fall, is
that Ridley will be the highest-graded wide receiver for most
clubs. Depending on who you talk to there are one, two, maybe three
wide receivers that will come off the board in Round 1. Of course, all
of that could change if a couple of players blow up the scouting
combine next month or fall on their faces with poor measurables and
drill work. Kirk, from Texas A\&M, has been compared to \textbf{Golden Tate} by
some, and Tate is a pretty good wide receiver but not the kind of guy
you would project coming off the board in the top 10 picks or maybe
even the top half of the first round. Sutton has a chance to help
himself at the combine. He has good size — listed at 6-foot-4, 218
pounds (we’ll see what he measures in Indianapolis) — and was super
productive at SMU with consecutive 1,000-yard seasons and 31 career
touchdowns. He did his work against defensive backs in the American
Athletic Conference. He’s interesting, but I don’t know if he’s No. 8
pick interesting. To address your final question, the Bears absolutely
cannot reach at No. 8 if they’re not in love with the player. Let me
explain why. Yes, they have a glaring need at wide receiver and the
position was woefully undermanned in 2017. You’re right, it seems
unlikely some of the best free-agent possibilities will be available,
and the Packers already took the best possibility off the market with
an extension for Davante Adams back in December. But if the Bears
reach for a wide receiver at No. 8 and it proves to be reach, what do
they have in three years? They’ll have an overdrafted wide receiver
who hasn’t lived up to the investment. If they draft a player at —
pick your position — who does meet expectations of the draft slot,
they’ve got a really good player in three years. What are you better
off with?''

I could not agree more.

No matter what the need at wide reciever the Bears absolutely cannot
afford to reach with this pick.  Most of what I've heard from scouts
and media experts indicates to me that there isn't a sure \#1 type
reciever in this draft.  To me that means most of these guys won't be
impact players.  And an impact player is what the Bears need more than
anything else, almost regardless of position.

The key is to take the best available at a position of need.  It
needn't be the greatest need and the Bears have enough of them to
where there is no excuse for concentrating on a single group of players
who do not give the team the best playmakers available.

\item \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-nfl-draft-pass-rusher-kyle-fuller-mailbag-20180215-story.html}{Another question for Biggs}:
  
  \begin{quote}
    ``I’ve read a lot of comments from fans and “experts” about how
    various players should be cut or signed or kept. But last year’s
    coaching staff really struggled taking advantage of players’
    strengths. Shouldn’t it take some time for this staff to
    objectively evaluate what the players on offense can do? Was last
    year really a fair evaluation? What if \textbf{Hroniss Grasu}, just one
    example, can actually play center? — John R., Saigon, Vietnam,
    from email

    ``You make some fair points that will certainly be considered by
    the Bears as they plot the moves that will lead them into the new
    league year beginning March 14. I agree that if they see an
    underperforming player from 2017 being a fit for what they would
    like to do, absolutely they will keep that player around. They
    have plenty of salary-cap flexibility, so that’s not going to sway
    them one way or the other. It’s about projection, fit and
    durability. I don’t know if Grasu is a great example because he
    remains under contract on his rookie deal and will almost surely
    be with the team heading into training camp.''
  \end{quote}
  
  Actualy he's a pretty awful example.  Grasu just isn't strong enough
  and he's always going to struggle with a nose guard lined up right
  over him.  In fairness, he's not alone in that regard and I'm sure
  there are things you can do to help him.  But Grasu isn't going to
  suddenly emerge as even an average center no matter who the coaches
  are.  He lacks stature and ability and coaches can't work miracles
  where that is the case.

  If Gasu wasn't a draft pick with a reasonably cheap salary, I
  believe he'd have been cut by now and replaced with an upgrade.
  That may happen this year.

\item \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-nfl-draft-pass-rusher-kyle-fuller-mailbag-20180215-story.html}{Yet another good question for Biggs}:

  \begin{quote}
    ``How do you see \textbf{Ryan Pace} filling the backup QB void with \textbf{Mike
    Glennon} most likely to be cut? — @nickmau91

    ``My best guess is the Bears will seek a veteran to serve as the
    No. 2 behind Mitch Trubisky. You can’t rule out the possibility
    the Bears will use a draft pick on a quarterback, but considering
    the wealth of needs elsewhere and the benefit of having an
    experienced player in a reserve role, I tend to think they go the
    veteran route.''

  \end{quote}

  I think the interesting question here is what will the Bears do with
  the \#3 quarterback slot.  This is traditionally used for a
  developmental quarterback.  Presumably in the Bears case, they'd be
  looking to develp a potential long-term back up. That could be a
  late draft pick but, if not, the Bears are going to be an attractive
  destination for the best undrafted free agents available.

  The Bears are rumored to be interested in former Washington State quarterback \textbf{Luke Falk} and
  they did talk to him at the Senior Bowl.  But the guess here is that the
  only way they'd take him is if he had a very significant fall to the
  lower rounds.

  Not the most critical question about the Bears roster by any means.
  But, like the say, the most popular player on the roster is the back up quarterback.

  \begin{quote}
    ``Will \textbf{Tarik Cohen} and \textbf{Adam Shaheen} be limited
    this year, too, because they struggled to learn \textbf{Dowell Loggains}’
    offense and now have to learn Matt Nagy’s? — @occamsdragon

    ``I don’t think that’s fair to Cohen or Shaheen. For starters, I
    don’t think you can say Cohen struggled to learn the offense last
    season. Quite the opposite. He learned a ton. The Bears lined
    Cohen up all over the field and he did well at a lot of different
    positions. He played running back, slot receiver, he lined up on
    the outside at wide receiver and he learned responsibilities in
    the return game for punts and kicks. That’s a full plate right
    there. Were fans frustrated Cohen wasn’t involved more in the
    third-down package and the hurry-up offense the team used late in
    games?  Sure. I get that. Cohen was also 5-foot-6, 181 pounds and
    had he blown a pass-blocking assignment or been flat run over by a
    pass rusher and quarterback \textbf{Mitch Trubisky} was injured, Loggains
    would have been on the first train out of town. That’s not
    something a lot of people were willing to consider when clamoring
    for Cohen to be used more. Can he be utilized more in the new
    scheme? No doubt. But he’s probably still a joker back no matter
    who is designing the offense. Shaheen was making the major jump
    from Division II and yes it took him some time to pick things up,
    but who didn’t expect that? Remember, Greg Olsen was a little slow
    to be assimilated into the offense when he was a first-round pick
    in 2007 coming out of a pro-style offense at Miami. I’d expect
    both players to be improved and productive in 2018.''
  \end{quote}
    In fairness to the questioner, Cohen \href{https://sports.yahoo.com/bears-got-tarik-cohen-field-003109057.html?src=rss}{did say
      himself}
    that he had trouble learning the plays albeit, as Biggs points
    out, that's partly because he was put in so many positions all
    over the field.

    My guess is that Shaheen has less trouble translating what he
    learned last year to the new offense.  Though the scheme is
    different, a lot of what was difficult was undoubtedly just
    learning to play the tight end position to a professional standard
    after spending his college career at Ashland.  The guess here is
    that a lot of it was simply learning how to block and how to use
    his body more effectively in the passing game.  That will be
    something he won't have to learn again regardless of scheme.

    I'm not too worried about either of these players struggling
    simply because they are in a new scheme.
  \item Last one

    \begin{quote}
      `` What do you think the chances of re-signing \textbf{Kyle Fuller}
      are? Can’t have another homegrown player get away, a la \textbf{Alshon
      Jeffrey} last year. — @dwhite4120

    ``That’s a great question and one that will be very interesting to
    watch develop in the coming weeks. The Bears can keep Fuller in
    place with the franchise or transition tag. Short of that, he will
    be headed to the open market and if I’m him, I’m seeing what my
    market value is before I make a decision about signing
    anywhere. The Bears have to weigh a lot of factors when
    considering their move here and Fuller’s performance during 2017
    will lead them to think long and hard about keeping him in a Bears
    uniform. I’d hesitate a little comparing him to Jeffery because
    all of these situations have their own factors. Fuller’s situation
    is in a lot of ways very, very different from Jeffery, who emerged
    earlier in his career.  Stay tuned.''

    \end{quote}
    It looks like the chances of the Bears re-signing Fuller are
    pretty grim.  \textbf{Jason La Canfora} at \textit{CBS Sports}
    \href{http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2759890-kyle-fuller-reportedly-wont-be-re-signed-by-bears-enters-free-agency}{is
      reporting}
    that Fuller is likely to price out the Bears which I'm guessing
    means that they aren't offering what he thinks is going to be his
    market value.

    Though Fuller was a valuable piece last year and it would be nice
    to have him back, its worth noting that \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-cornerbacks-review-kyle-fuller-biggs-20180215-story.html}{most of the teams the
    Bears faced perferred to challenge him rather than \textbf{Prince
      Amukamura}} on the other side.  And then there's that flakey
    situation in 2016 where the Bears thought Fuller was ready to play
    and he refused.

    I don't find it hard to believe that the Bears aren't offering
    what Fuller wants.  But I do wonder if its the right call.  We
    hear about the dangers of signing other teams castoffs in free
    agency every year.  Perhaps there's something about Fuller that
    has turned the Bears off.  But otherwise, if you are going to
    overpay someone, finding a way to pay your own guy seems like the
    way to go.
