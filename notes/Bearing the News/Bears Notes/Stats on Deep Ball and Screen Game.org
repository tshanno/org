10-step plan Matt Nagy will follow to fix the Bears offense

12 hours ago

A lot of pressure is on the shoulders of Chicago Bears head coach Matt Nagy. Over the course of the last several seasons the Bears offense has been
among the worst in the NFL. When former head coach John Fox took over in 2015 and brought along Adam Gase as his offensive coordinator, the unit
should some signs of life. Gase went on to be named the head coach of the Miami Dolphins in 2016, leaving Fox to promote quarterbacks coach Dowell
Loggains to the title of offensive coordinator.

Whether it was Loggains who was limiting the potential of the offense, or it was Fox who had a stranglehold on how the team's offense should be run, it was
a rough two seasons with the Bears on that side of the ball. In 2016 the unit saw Jay Cutler, Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley all start under center with mixed
results, Jordan Howard became a Pro Bowler as a rookie (after the team did not start him in the first three games) and watched Alshon Jeffery leave in free
agency after the season. Last year the Bears did a bit more to add some weapons on offense, moving up in the draft to take Mitch Trubisky second overall
and adding a dynamic playmaker in Tarik Cohen in the fourth round.

After another season in which Chicago's offense was among the worst in the league, general manager Ryan Pace set out to overhaul that side of the ball.
Nagy comes to Chicago with previous experience as the offensive coordinator in Kansas City and he will call plays out of the gate. Nagy also brought along
a new offensive coordinator in former Oregon head coach Mark Helfrich and added one of the best offensive line coaches in all of football in Harry Hiestand
to the mix.

While Loggains relied heavily on a lot of the same plays, often getting too caught up in the trying to establish the run when it wasn't working, while Nagy
brings with him a proven offensive system that can do a lot of creative things with a lot of different players. Take a look below to see what steps Nagy can
take to fix the Bears offense this season in his first year in Chicago.
