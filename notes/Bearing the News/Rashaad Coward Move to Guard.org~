Can you give us a little information about Rashaad Coward moving to guard? How often do things like this work out? I can’t think of any
Bears moving positions like this in recent history. Curious what they saw in Coward. — @dj_jaco_10

When the Bears were strapped for offensive linemen in practice last season, they briefly moved Coward to the other side of the ball. He caught the
attention of the organization at that point. There was discussion during the offseason about what to do with the undrafted player from Old Dominion,
who appeared in one game for the Bears as a rookie. Should they allow him to compete at nose guard as a potential role player behind Eddie
Goldman or give him a shot with a position switch? The decision was made to flip him to guard. It’s certainly interesting, given his 6-foot-5,
320-pound frame and his ability to move. There’s no question it will take some time, and position switches for undrafted players are long shots. Let’s
be realistic: The odds already are stacked against undrafted players. The Bears liked the way Coward worked last season, though. A similar
transition worked for the team with former defensive tackle-turned-right tackle James “Big Cat” Williams — although that was a quarter-century ago.
