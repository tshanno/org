\subsection*{Offense}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Bears obviously came out wanting to run the ball and failed miserably early.  They eventually did better but I still don't think the running game is on point yet.
\item They evidently liked the match up of Allen Robinson on Janoris Jenkins.  Jenkins was playing the short pass all the way and the Bears had little success.  You wondered if they were setting Jenkins up for a double move down the line but it never came.
\item I'm having a hard time understanding what the Bears see in Taquan Mizzell.  He seems to be getting a lot of chances to play but I haven't been impressed, yet.
\item I was glad to see Tarik Cohen take advantage of a cut back lane in the first quarter on a fourth and short run.  Jordan Howard started doing the same thing shortly afterwards.  We need to see more of that.
\item Wonderful 30 yard catch by Allen Robinson early in the second quarter as he went up for another 50-50 ball and took it down off of the defender's helmet.  This seems to be his strength and the Bears need to better take advantage of it.
\item The Giants did a great job of reading the Bears screen passes and covering them.  They seemed to be anticipating them.
\item Taylor Gabriel totally failed to show up today.  He had a bad miscommunication with Chase Daniel in the first quarter and a bad drop in the third that would have been a badly needed first down.  I don't think I even need to mention the horrible fumble in the fourth quarter that esentially allowed the Giants to salt the game away.
\item The Bears came out in the second half and evidently decided that they needed to go down field more.  It resulted in Daneil seeing a lot of pressure from a blitzing defense and, yet, he seemed to have a tough time finding an open man.  Something evidently wan't operating correctly and the Bears looked out of sync.  The Giants had 3 sacks.
\item The last drive in the fourth quarter with the Bears in general and Tarik Cohen in particular making some huge plays was impressive.  The offense came up big when, truthfully, the vanted Bears defense came up short again late in the game.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Defense}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The Giants tried to fed their two stars, Odell Beckham and Saquon Barkley.  It's evident that the Bears were very aware of these two and they were determined not to let them beat them.  It seemed that it was up to the rest of the Giants to win this.
  \item THat worked until the second half when trhe Giants apprently adjusted and Barkley all of the sudden came alive with some good runs.
  \item The Bears often decided to drop 8 into coverage and only rush three.  It was an interesting decision.  Eli Manning had a lot of time to throw despite having a weak offensive line.
  \item The Bears mixed it up but they also played a lot of man-to-man.  They evidently liked their defensive backs matched up on the Giants receivers.  That included Beckham.  No one followed him around and they didn't change their coverages for him but let him match up on whoever was opposite him.
  \item Interesting gadget play for a touchdown as Odell Beckham threw to a wide open Russel Shepard for 49 yards.  The Giants pulled out all of the stops.
  \item The third touchdown pass to Odell Beckham was just inexcusable.  I'm guessing that Roquon Smith missed him in coverage and he was wide open.  Terrible mistake.
  \item Akeim Hicks had a great game as he schooled Nate Solder with penetration and a number of tackles for loss.
  \item Having said that, kudos to the Giants offensive line for the nice job they did of blocking today, especially in the second half when there were a number of big runs.
  \item Eli Manning has a gift for knowing how to ground a ball by throwing it to a player ``in the area''.  It shows good awareness on his part.
  \item Many people have noted the Bears inability of stpoping teams in the fourth quarter.  The problem showed up again today and the Bears had a hard time getting a badly needed stop with 5:00 left in the game.  The way the defense was playing, I would absolutely have gone for 2 on the last touchdown of the fourth quarter to go for the win rather than waiting for over time.
  \item The Giants really liked the match up of Sterling Shepard on Bryce Callahan.  It looked to me like he was getting open pretty consistently.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection*{Miscellaneous}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Kevin Burkhardt and Charles Davis were your announcers.  I think Burkhardt is a potential star as play-by-play announcers go.  He and Davis seem to have chemistry.  Davis is fine and I think he hits all of the important points.  But it seem that there's a lot of pointing out the obvious going on with him.  There aren't a lot of, ``Wow, I would have never thought of that'' moments.

  \item  Special Teams
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Taquan Mizzell fumbled the opening kickoff.  
    \item The Giants were obviously kicking short not believing that the Bears could return the ball to the 25 yard line - correctly.
    \item Neil O'Donnell had a nice 65 yard punt in the first quarter to put the Giants all the way back at the 25 yard line.  He was punting form the Bears end zone and kept the Giants from having good field position.
    \item Terrible missed block by Curtis Riley to allow Daniel Brown through the front line to recover the onside kick in the fourth quarter.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item Penalties

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Mario Edwards had some big penalties as the Giants did their best to shoot themselves in the foot early.
    \item The referees in this game seemed to be throwing flags about every other play.  The teams combined for 17 penalties for 147 yards.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Turnovers
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Alex Ogletree intercepted the second play of the game.  It wasn't a great start for the Bears.
    \item Kyle Filler jumped an Odell Beckham route as time was running out in the first quarter.  Ogletree immediately proceeded to intercept it right back.  The Giants went three and out and punted so nothing came of it.
    \item Taylor Gabriel wrapped up a terrible game with a terrible fumble on the Bears 10 yard line with the Bears down a touchdown.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Bears head coach Matt Nagy will get a lot of criticism for calling time out instead of letting the time run out with the ball on the Giants side of the field with 17 seconds left in the half.  Saquon Barkley ran the ball for 21 yards and a quick out on the play that followed set up a successful field goal for the Giants.  I, also, found the decision to be frustrating.  But in fairness to Nagy, the defense has to stop that Barkley run.  The Giants were just running out the half and you can't let that kind of conservative play call go for that many yards.
  \item You frequently got the impression watching this game that the Bears were having trouble with the footing on what looked like a pretty damp day.  The field didn't look like it was in the best of shape.  The Bears also evidently had a hard time hanging on to the football.
  \item The Bears inability to convert third downs was a big part of this game.  They were only 2 orf 13 on third down in regulation.
  \item Terrible loss for the Packers to the Arizona Cardinals.  I thought they had a chance to run the table for 9 wins but I donâ€™t think 8 will do it.  It going to be really interesting to see what happens to McCarthy after the year.
  \item The Giants definitely deserved to win this game as they played well and with an intensity that the Bears failed to match.  The Bears weren't as flat as they were against the Dolphins earlier in the year coming off of their bye but the long time off between the end of their three game stretch of divisional games on Thanksgiving Day game and the game today obviously had an effect.

    \begin{minipage}{1.0\linewidth}
      This was a pretty bad loss in terms of the Bears playoff hopes.  With games against the Packers, Vikings and Rams left, wins against the Giants and the 49ers were going to be the easiest path to 10 wins and the playoffs.  They failed to take care of business here and it may burn them in the end.
