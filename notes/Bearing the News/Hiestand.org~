Everybody loves \textbf{Harry Hiestand}.

The Bears have drawn

  reviews} for hiring Hiestand from fans, former players and media.
From \textbf{Kevin Fishbain} at \textit{The Athletic}:

\begin{quote}
NFL insiders declared it a coup for new head coach Matt Nagy to bring in Hiestand.

Many echoed what one league source said about Hiestand, “The best in the business.”
\end{quote}

There's a part of me that wants to accept this at face value.  But
Hiestand's history has me wondering if this isn't all just a prt of
the honeymoon period that follows the hiring of a new head coach.

Here's the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hiestand}{list of places Heistand has coached}:

\begin{tabbing}
East Stroudsburg (1981–1982)
Student assistant
East Stroudsburg (1983–1985)
Offensive line coach
Penn (1986–1987)
Tight ends coach
USC (1987–1988)
Graduate assistant
Toledo (1988–1989)
Offensive line coach
Cincinnati (1989–1993)
Offensive coordinator/offensive line coach
Missouri (1994–1996)
Offensive line coach
Illinois (1997–1999)
Offensive line coach
Illinois (2000–2004)
Assistant head coach/offensive line coach

Tennessee (2010–2011)
Offensive line coach
Notre Dame (2012–2017)

Chicago Bears (2018–present)

\end{tabbing}

See anything unusual?  Let me make it easier:

\begin{tabbing}
East Stroudsburg (1981–1982) \> college
East Stroudsburg (1983–1985) \> college
Penn (1986–1987) \> college

Toledo (1988–1989) \> college
Cincinnati (1989–1993) \> college
Missouri (1994–1996) \> college
Illinois (1997–2004) \> college
Chicago Bears (2005–2009) \> pro
Tennessee (2010–2011) \> college
Notre Dame (2012–2017)  \> college
Chicago Bears (2018–present)  \> pro
\end{tabbing}

One professional team - the Bears.

If Hiestand is really the best in the business, why are the Bears the only professinal team that was apparently clamouring to hire him?

In fairness there are a lot of possible reasons why Hiestand might be
particular about the jobs he's worked.  It is possible, for instance,
that he his family is in Chicago.  In that case, staying at Notre Dame
would have been his preference after 2009 when, presumably, he was let
go with former offensive coordinator \textbf{Ron Turner}.  But then,
if he was ``the best in the business'', why didn't former head coach
\textbf{Lovie Smith} keep him on?

But that's a lot of reading between the lines and I could do more if I
chose to.  But you get the idea.  There's enough smoke here to make me
wonder if there isnt' fire and I'm wondering if all of this praise of
Hiestand isn't just so much hype.
