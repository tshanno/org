\section*{Quick Game Comments:  Chargers at Bears 10/27/19}

\subsection*{Defense}

\begin{enumerate}
\item I'd say the Bears defense generally played with some extra energy today on defense.  They definitely came out with an edge.
\item Interestingly after playing much more 3-4 base defense for the first 6 games of the season, the Bears played mostly in the nickel formation today.  That probably means that they didn't have much respect for the Chargers running game.  With reason.
\item The Bears also played a lot more zone defense.  The guess here is that it was meant to generate more big plays with the defenders facing the quarterback
\item To my eye, the Bears got better play from the defensive line this week.  That made a huge difference in the run defense and the pass rush.
\item Having said that, the Bears had a tough time getting pressure on Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers.  If you are going to play a lot of zone defense you have to get pressure with a four man rush.  Neither Khalil Mack nor Leonard Floyd got much pressure.  The Bears eventually had to resort to the blitz.
\item I also thought Roquan Smith played better today as well as he showed up more often around the ball.
\item The Chargers came out of half time with adjustments and had some big gains on some zone beaters.
\item Having a hard time understanding what was wrong with Keenan Allen but the guy looked like he was running on ice.  He couldn't keep his feet.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Offense}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Bears came out running and definitely committed to it this week.  The result of that patience with the run game was some good runs.  They gained 162 yards on 38 rushing attempts.
\item Having said that calling a running play as the clock wound down at the end of the first half with no timeouts was a bit boneheaded.  I'm not big on criticizing play calling but having to spike the ball on 3rd down with one second left isn't great clock management.  A pass into the end zone would have given them one more shot at the end zone.
\item Trubisky was inconsistent as usual but had some decent to good throws today.  Notably, those throws came when he had good protection and didn't see much pressure.  The better protection can, I think, be partly attributed to the commitment to the run.  Chargers pass rushers had to slow down for fear of it and the Chargers linebackers had to play it.
\item The troubles in the red zone were notably for the Bears today.  Four trips into the red zone in the first half yielded 9 points.  That can't happen.
\item The commitment to the running game gave the Bears a definitive advantage in time of possession in the first half.  They almost doubled the Chargers in that stat in the first half.  The final stat was 37:56 to 22:00.
\item Bobby Massie had a tough time with Joey Bosa all day.  Bosa got a critical sack with 2:30 to play taking the Bears out of field goal range.  You had to wonder why the Bears gave him no help on such a critical play knowing what a sack would mean.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Miscellaneous}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Thom Brennaman and Chris Spielman were your announcers.  Brennaman is a pro.  Spielman isn't my cup of tea.  He spends a lot of time critiquing individual players but I don't find his insight to be compelling and to my mind he added little to the game.
\item  Eddie Pineiro missed a field goal early as did Chargers kicker Chase McLaughlin.  Of course, Pineiro missed the game winner.
\item Drops weren't a big issue for the Bears but the Chargers had one or two that were drive killers.  Mike Williams and Keenan Allen both dropped a touchdown.
\item Penalties were horrendous for the Chargers.  The stat line won't show it as bad as it was because the Bears refused some but the ones that counted were damaging.  The Chargers had the Bears off the field in the red zone twice and twice let them off the hook with penalties - one horse collar tackle and one pass interference in the end zone.  The Bears still only scored a field goal but it was still really poor play.  Rashad Coward had a bad game with multiple penalties.
\item Kyle Fuller had an interception deep in Los Angeles territory.  The Bears converted only a field goal.  Trubisky threw an interception early in the fourth quarter that set the Chargers up on the Bears 20 yard line.  He also gave up a fumble midway through the quarter, also in deep in Bears territory at the 25 yard line.
\item Well, the Chargers did everything they could to hand the Bears this game and the Bears just wouldn't take it.  The Bears playoff hopes are gradually fading.
