\section*{Quick Comments:  49ers at Bears 2017-12-03}
\subsection{Defense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Bears went from playing the best team in the NFC to the
  worst but it looked the same at the line of scrimmage early.  The
  Bears were dominated.  They struggled to stop the run and they
  couldn't get a pass rush.  They never really got much penetration
  against the run all game.
\item I'll cut them a little break on the pass rush.  The Bears seemed
  to think that the best way to play the 49ers new quarterback Jimmy
  Garoppolo was to drop 8 into coverage and rush three.  It wasn't
  working too well early to my eye and apparently the Bears agreed.
  They started to blitz more in the second quarter and, naturally,
  started getting more pressure.
\item I thought it was interesting to see the 49ers occasionally go to
  the hurry up with a quarterback that supposedly wasn't up to speed
  with the offense.  Generally speaking I thought Garoppolo did a pretty good job with it.
\item I found this game to be extremely frustrating to watch as the
  bears struggled to get off the field.  The 49ers dominated the time
  of possession and dissected the Bears zone defense pretty much as
  easily as the Eagles did last week, holding the ball about twice as
  long as the Bears.  In fairness, it was bend and don't break and the
  49ers settled to field goal after field goal and I suppose giving up
  15 points could be considered to be a successful game.  But it
  looked like the Bears were trying to hang around and let the 49ers
  stop themselves rather than stopping them with aggressive play.
\item Like a lot of teams before them, the 49ers went right at Kyle
  Fuller and avoided Prince Amukamara.
\item The 49ers started to attack the middle in the passing game in
  the second quarter.  That makes sense given that the Bears were
  starting Chris Prosinski, who they re-signed just this week.
\item The 49ers had good success rolling Garoppolo out.  He's more
  mobile than he looks and he throws well on the run.  You'd like to
  see the Bears do that more with Trubisky.
\item Garoppolo is also extremely accurate and has a pretty good arm.
  I'm impressed.
\item Lamarr Houston got a sack and all I could think was ``Don't blow
  the knee.  Don't blow the knee.''

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Offense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Bears relied heavily on the run and the short pass early.
  They seem to have rediscovered the slant pass as they successfully
  threw several early.
\item The Bears concentrated heavily on passes over the middle.  I
  don't know if that's a nod to Trubisky to keep the play in front of
  him and limit his reads or if they just think the 49ers are weak
  there.
\item Dontrelle Inman looks like a find.  He looks better than a \#4
  receiver which is what he was billed as.  Of course, we wouldn't
  know what a good \#2 or \#1 looks like around here anymore.
\item Trubisky generally looked more accurate today which was
  encouraging.
\item Trubisky struggled to find open receivers.  How much of that was
  him and how much the receivers was hard to tell.  The replays often
  showed open men.  You wonder if head coach John Fox hasn't made him
  gun shy in an effort to prevent turnovers.
\item Neither Charles Leno nor Bobby Massie had a great game today.
  Both allowed pressure and Leno had a damaging holding penalty in the
  fourth quarter.
\item This was a pretty miserable offensive game for the Bears.  They
  struggled to get first downs, struggled to block the edges and
  struggled to get open.  It was tough to watch.
\end{enumerate}
  
  
\subsection{Miscellaneous}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Andrew Catalon and James Lofton were your announcers.  The
  broadcast was a bare bones affair without much of the detailed
  analysis of replays that we often see.  The network seemed to be
  more focused on bringing back historical footage of both teams than
  in providing insight into the current game.  Lofton didn't teach me
  a whole lot.  Overall, nothing special.
\item The Bears had punter Neil O'Donnell kicking off.  That's unusual
  but he did a pretty good job.  At the same time, it led to
  speculation that new kicker Cairo Santos was having trouble with his
  previously injured groin.

  Tarik Cohen had an amazing 60 yard punt return where he reversed
  field.  That was worth the price of admission.

  Cohen had another wonderful return in the fourth quarter that was
  brought back due to a block in the back.  It was a bad penalty away
  from the ball by Ben Braunecker.

  Generally speaking I wasn't impressed with the 49ers discipline on
  the coverage teams.  They also looked slower than the Bears.  Or at
  least too slow to keep up with Cohen.

  % Cohen
  Cohen, on the other hand, had an amazing game both offensively and
  on special teams.
  
\item A Charles Leno holding call killed a Tarik Cohen 25 yard run in
  the second quarter.  Having said that the 49ers killed themselves
  with repeated penalties in the first half with 6 for 43 yards.
\item Drops
\item Kyle Fuller got a big interception in the first quarter.  Fuller
  was itching to get one as he'd gotten a couple good breaks on the
  ball on passes before that.
  
\item ``Tough to watch'' pretty much sums up this game.  Most of it
  was simply watching the 49ers offense operate against a Bears
  defense that didn't seem real interested in the kind of aggressive
  play that might have stopped them.  Special teams weren't bad even
  considering the kicker apparently had a bad groin.  But the Bears
  offense was more miserable than usual and couldn't move the ball.

  This was generally ugly, ugly football.  It doesn't look like the
  kind of football most of the rest of the league is playing.  It
  certainly doesn't look like the kind of football a team on the rise
  is supposed to be playing.
