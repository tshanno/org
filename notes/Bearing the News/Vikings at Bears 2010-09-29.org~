\textbf{Defense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Vikings came out and went right at Stefon Diggs matched up on Prince Amukamara.  It was obvious that was a match up they were going to like.  The Lions picked on Amukamara a bit last week.
\item The Vikings were also attacking Kyle Fuller, trying to take advantage of his aggressiveness with double moves.
\item The Vikings were also trying a lot of trap plays in the running game, again taking advantage of the Bears aggressiveness.
\item Khalil Mack is a monster.  The Bears got a lot of pressure on Kirk Cousins and did a nice job of disrupting his play.
\item The run defense was stout as well.  The Vikings had less than 2 yards per rush and very few attempts. Akiem HIcks was a big part of that.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Offense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item It seems that the Bears thought they could attack the Vikings offense on the ground to the outside on the right side.  They stacked their tight ends to that side and ran quite a bit there.  It didn't work but the Bears kept trying it.
\item The Vikings had a good game plan very similar to the Green Bay game plan the first game of the year.  They blitzed the Bears offense from a lot of angles as often as possible and mixed their defensive looks.  To my eye, the Bears handled it much better than they did against the Packers - as they should have, given 9 games in head coach Matt Nagy's offense.
\item Mitch Trubisky needed to be patient tonight.  The Vikings were giving up the underneath throws and covering the deep routes to Gabriel, challenging them to play mistake-free football and work their way down the field.
\item The Vikings spent a lot of time in what looked like a two deep zone.  The Bears were having a hard time early solving it and, as you might expect from the Vikings, they got a fair bit of pressure on Trubisky.
\item Not entirely sure why the bears went for two on their first touchdown.  The situation didn't ordinarily call for it.  I can only assume that they had a play that they liked.  And it worked.  A nice throw to Anthony Miller in the back of the end zone.
\item I was impressed by the concerted effort the Bears put into running the ball this game.  They haven't done it well the last few weeks but they're working at it and they were better tonight.
\end{enumerate}



\textbf{Miscellaneous}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth, and Michele Tafoya were your announcers.  I've said many times that this is the best announcing team in football.
  
\item Special teams
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Cody Parkey hit his first field goal right down central which was good to see after last week's adventure when he missed four kicks.
  \item Of course, he followed that up by kicking the ball off out of bounds giving the Vikings great field position.
  \item Parkey's 48 yard field goal mad ethe Vikings climb an up hill one with less than 3 minutes left in the game.  It gave teh Bears a two score lead.  Quite a redemption for him.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Penalties
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Kyle Fuller had a pass interference call in the first quarter.  It gave the Vikings a first down on third and three.  Eventually the Vikings Dalvin Cook fumbled deep in Bears territory, limiting the damage.
  \item A holding call on Ben Braunecker in the first quarter pushed the Bears back from the Viking 8 to the 18.  The Bears scored the touchdown anyway.
  \item Akiem Hicks got a very damaging roughing the passer penalty that gave the Vikings another shot at a two point conversion.  They made it to make it a one score game with about 4 minutes left in the game.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Drops weren't a major factor in this game.
\item Turnovers
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Khalil Mack forced a huge Dalvin Cook fumble in the first quarter.  The Vikings were driving deep into Chicago territory and the turnover saved at least 3 points and very likely 7.
  \item Mitch Trubisky threw an interception and gave the ball back shortly after the fumble recovery.  He threw into what looked like triple coverage.
  \item Trubisky had another amaging interception on one of his classic overthrows late in the third quarter that gave teh Viings the ball at the Chicago 31 yard line.  It resulted in a Vikings field goal.
  \item That was followed by a fumble by Tarik Cohen that gave teh Vikings the ball on the Bears 30 yard line.  That also resulted in a field goal.
  \item Eddie Jackson's pick six was, of course, a huge play in  this game with the Bears offense struggling in the second half.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Well, we figured this game would tell us if the Bears are contenders or pretenders.  I won't say either team played to thier potential offensively but they definitely competed with a pretty good team tonight right to the end.  I'm calling them contenders.  For now.  :)
