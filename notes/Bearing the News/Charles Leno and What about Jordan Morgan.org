\textbf{Brad Biggs} at the \textit{Chicago Tribune} \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-offensive-line-decisions-biggs-20180127-story.html}{discusses the possibility that the Bears will select an offensive lineman}, perhaps in the first round.  Biggs is at the Senior Bowl:

\begin{quote}
  ``[A] scout stopped in front of his hotel and said, 'I get why you’re asking me about \textbf{Calvin} [\textbf{Ridley}] but I think the Bears will draft a lineman.'''
  ``One of the first things general manager \textbf{Ryan Pace} must do is make a decision on the future of left guard \textbf{Josh Sitton}, who was a team captain in 2017. He has a team option for 2018 that must be exercised between Feb. 9, five days after Super Bowl LII, and March 9, five days before the start of the new league year. Sitton is due to earn \$8 million with a \$7.4 million base salary, \$500,000 in per-game roster bonuses and a \$100,000 workout bonus — but only if the team picks up the option.

  ``Next, the Bears will need to determine if they want to pay a \$1 million roster bonus to right tackle Bobby Massie on March 16 when they will be three days into free agency.

  ``How the Bears navigate these decisions will provide clues for how the team will proceed in free agency and later in the draft when perhaps they will consider Notre Dame guard Quenton Nelson with the eighth overall pick or maybe an offensive tackle. They also could consider a guard in later rounds.''

  ``Perhaps the scout is right and they wind up going with a lineman in the first round. That seems more likely if they move on from Sitton.''

\href{http://bearingthenews.com/blog/2018/01/20/playoff-quarterbacks-points-view/}{As I said in a previous post}, one thing I don't understand is why last
year's 5th round pick, \textbf{Jordan Morgan} is never mentioned in
these conversations.  Of course, the Bears would be fools to put all
of their eggs in that basket and Morgan did spend the year on IR which
undoubtedly limited his development.  But still, you'd think the
possibility that he could earn the job would at least be addressed.

But though I wouldn't discount the possibility that the scout ws
talking about guard or replacing right tackle \textbf{Bobbie Massie},
which Biggs also addressed, I'm not so sure.  One thing I've noticed
in talking to people who follow other teams, and in particular, in the
media outside of Chicago is that people dont' thin much of left tackle
\textbf{Charles Leno}.  Certainly they don't rate him anywhere near as
highly as the Bears evidently do.

For example, PFF mentioned Leno as being
\href{https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-pffs-midseason-all-worst-team}{among
  the worst players in the league at his position} in 2015.  They also
\href{https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-bears-ot-leno-reportedly-close-on-contract-extension}{rated
  him just 42nd out of 76 qualifying tackles in 2016}.  Though
\href{https://www.profootballfocus.com/nfl/players/charles-leno/8880}{that
  may have come up a bit this year} its evident that they aren't big
fans and I think that opinion seems to be often shared.

\textbf{Hub Arkush} at \textit{Pro Football Weekly} \href{http://www.profootballweekly.com/lists/2017/08/24/e6407cccdb6549118a0c1002c8ad9977/index.xml?page=2}{has been a particularly vocal critic locally}.

I don't think the Bears are sandbagging with Leno.  I think they
really like him and they committed to him with a long-term contract.
But its evident that the rest of the league generally doesn't agree
and that might be affecting the way that scouts and general managers
are expecting the Bears to go in this draft.
