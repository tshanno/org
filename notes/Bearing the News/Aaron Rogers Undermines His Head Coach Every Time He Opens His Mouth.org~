  \begin{quote}
    [General Manager \textbf{Ryan}] \textbf{Pace} saw the inconsistencies this season as Trubisky completed 63.2\% of his passes for 3,138 yards, 17 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. But said he believes the potential for Trubisky’s development is still “wide open,” noting there were times when the quarterback responded well to adverse game situations.

“You see moments this year (where you say), 'Aha, there it is,’” Pace said. “And then we see the inconsistencies and the dips. We need to figure out why that's happening and work hard to solve that. And that's part of what this offseason is about.”
\end{quote}

A year ago someone who knows more about such things than I do told me that Trubisky didn't have it.  The major reason was that his foot work was atrocious.  I agreed but told him I thought this could be coached out of him.  Now, at the end of his third year in the league, I'm starting to understand his point of view.

This seems like the kind of thing that can and should be coached.  But apparently its not that easy.  Trubisky continues to have poor footwork, most obvious is his tendency to throw off of his back foot when there's no pressure around him.  Head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy} obviously recognizes the problem:

\begin{quote}
  Physically, Nagy is stressing Trubisky’s footwork in the pocket, an issue he said they discussed Monday night.

“(He needs) a little bit more trust where he’s not drifting out (of the pocket),” Nagy said. “There were times throughout this year where (it’s) focusing on trusting the center of that pocket, pushing forward, and now he’s a running threat.
\end{quote}

There was a point at the very beginning of his career when Trubisky was better about all of this.  Anyone remember his very first preseason game?  It seems a long time ago when, for one week, he took the league by storm and everyone was wondering if great things were ahead.

In any case, Nagy needs to get back to the fundamentals with Trubisky.  Next year, instead of pushing Trubisky ahead in the offense, he needs to step back and concentrate on the fundamentals.  If Trubisky isn't solid there, nothing else will matter.
