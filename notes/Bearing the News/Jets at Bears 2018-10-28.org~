* Offense
** Good job by Mitch Trubisky finding a wide open Trey Burton on the opening drive.  Once again, we see the Bears trying to keep Trubisky comfortable by putting him in shot gun and letting him run, which he did effectively.
** Having said that, Trubisky was erratic again, throwing even easy passes that were just way off. He missed a pass to an open Taylor Gabriel in the second quarter that Gabriel couldn't have caught if he was 9 feet tall.
** And he was leaving the pocket early under pressure, again.  He ran right into a sack by Jason Pierre-Paul early in the first quarter.
** The play calling was very run heavy early against what looked like some light fronts.  Evidently the Bucs didn't' think the Bears could run on them but it looked like they were doing just fine.
** Having said that, Trubisky got good protection today.  Nice work at the line of scrimmage.  I was really surprised that the Bucs didn't blitz more given what Arizona did last week but I guess that's just not what they do.
** Trubisky's fade route to Allen Robinson was just fine in the first quarter.  Contrast with last week...
** Kudos to Tarik Cohen, who had pretty good game.  I'm always skeptical about how effective these little quick guys are going to be.  The numbers often don't seem to match the hype.  But the Bears put him to good use today and he looked like a mismatch all over the field.
** It was curious how the Bears kept putting James Daniels in and out at left guard.  I'm not entirely sure if it was systematic or if Eric Kush was hurt and just trying to get back in.
** Its been a long time since we've seen receivers this open around here.  The Bucs didn't help with some broken coverages but that wasn't all of it.  This is a real, big boy offense.
** Credit Kevin White.  He was all over the field with some good blocks today.  It doesn't sound like much but that's what good teams do.
* Defense
** The Bears looked like they were playing a lot of two deep safety looks in order to limit big plays.
** Nice play by the Bucs dragging a receiver across the field in front of the linebackers and holding them in coverage while DeSean Jackson suck across behind them.
** Ryan Fitzpatrick wasn't particularly accurate early in the game as he was consistently high on his passes.
** I really don't think anyone should leave an offensive tackle alone on Khalil Mack.  Its just not fair.
* Miscellaneous
** Thom Brennaman, Chris Spielman and Shannon Spake were your announcers.  I thought these guys did a pretty good job.  Spielman was pretty quick with insightful comments on replay immediately after big plays, giving you a good idea of what happened.  He seems to be pretty knowledgeable and he can communicate it.  I like him.
** Nice work by Tarik Cohen alertly jumping on a ball that hit DeAndre Houston-Carson in the back on a punt in the first quarter.
** Mike Evans had a bad drop early in the game.
** The Buccaneers were hit with a few bad penalties early including a number of offsides penalties.  Maybe Trubisky is getting better at the hard count.  

Akiem Hicks getting tossed from the game, even in a blow out, that's not good.  I'm surprised.  A suspension would be extremely bad.  As their best defensive lineman, they need him.

** Eddie Jackson with a nice interception near the end of the first half saved at least three points.  In fairness to Fitzgerald, it was 3rd and 19 and at 35-3, you don't settle for a field goal.  Danny Trevathan had an interception on a ball tipped by Mack with the Bucs driving at the beginning of the second half.
** So prepare for a week of national commentators telling you about how great the Bears are.  Don't fall for it.  They had a good day and the Bucs had a very bad day.  They aren't there yet.
