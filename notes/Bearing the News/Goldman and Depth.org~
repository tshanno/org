  ``What's your thoughts on the Bears signing \textbf{Johnathan Hankins}? I
  think it would be great to see him with \textbf{Akiem Hicks} and \textbf{Eddie
  Goldman}. Is the DL depth for the Bears being overlooked? It seems
  like a greater need than what is being talked about. —

  ``The Bears are not in play for Hankins at this point... I think the
  Bears are probably more interested in investing in their own player
  Goldman later in the year, or at least trying to get something
  done. With as many issues and roster holes the Bears needed to fill,
  they weren’t going to get them all covered in free agency, or the
  first two weeks of it anyway.

  The draft remains and that’s where the franchise can get the biggest
  boost for the remainder of this offseason. They’ve got to nail the
  draft and whether they add help up front (that wouldn’t surprise me)
  remains to be seen."

The Bears need to think seriously about extending Goldman.  Nose tackle isn't a big generator in terms of statistics and that makes it an undervalued part of the 3-4 defense. But the Bears defense wasn't the same two years ago after Goldman got hurt.

The Bears may be depending upon \textbf{Rashaad Coward} to develop into a reliable backup at this position in his second year.  But, like Biggs, I wouldn't be surprised if the Bears drafted a defensive lineman.

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the Bears drafted almost any position this year.  They need pass rush (who doesn't?) and they need a starting interior lineman.  But otherwise, like last year, what they need more than anything else is depth almost everywhere on the field, especially on defense.

As Biggs said, the Bears have to nail the draft.  Because when the injury bug hits, they're going to need the players they add there to step up.
