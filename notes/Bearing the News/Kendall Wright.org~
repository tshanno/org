  "I keep hearing people say it’s better for the Bears if all the top

  few of the top QBs dropped so the Bears are best positioned to trade

  ``I don’t know about that. There could be a damn good player sitting
  there at No. 8 if three quarterbacks come off the board in the top
  seven picks. If somehow, and I think this is a bit of a longshot,
  four quarterbacks go in the top seven, I know there will be a damn
  good football player available at No. 8. For the sake of discussion,
  let’s say three quarterbacks are selected in the top seven
  picks. Let’s assume Penn State running back \textbf{Saquon Barkley}
  and North Carolina State defensive end \textbf{Bradley Chubb} are
  also gone in the top seven picks. That’s five players off the board
  and that leaves Alabama defensive back \textbf{Minkah Fitzpatrick},
  Notre Dame guard \textbf{Quenton Nelson}, Virginia Tech linebacker
  \textbf{Tremaine Edmunds} and Georgia linebacker \textbf{Roquan
    Smith} as well as Ohio State cornerback \textbf{Denzel Ward} and
  Florida State safety \textbf{Derwin James}, among others. That’s a
  pretty good group if you ask me.''

It sounds like Biggs is drastically underestimating the odds that 4
quarterbacks are going off the board before the Bears pick.  The key is how highly do teams value that fourth guy, presumably former Oklahoma quarterback \textbf{Baker Mayfield}.

I've participated in a seven round mock draft with representatives
from the other 31 NFL teams every year for the last five or six years.
These guys know their teams and have a pretty good idea of what
they're thinking is.  The trends that come out of these mock drafts tend to be very representative of what happens on draft weekend.

Amongst other things, this group
\href{http://bearingthenews.com/blog/2017/04/25/bears-must-draft-quarterback-three-overall/}{very accurately predicted the run on first round quarterbacks last year} at a time when not that many people thought as many would go as early
as they did.

This year's mock started last week and I'm not allowed to release the results, yet.  But suffice it to say 4 quarterbacks went in the top 5 picks.

Book it.
