A couple thoughts on yesterday's second round haul:

\begin{itemize}
\item What I liked:  The \textbf{James Daniels} pick.

  I'm a ``football games are won and lost at the line of scrimmage'' guy and I always love to see offensvie linemen taken reasonably high because they benefit everyone on the field in so many ways.

I think the decision to play Daniels at left guard is smart.  Daniels had trouble as a center handling big linemen at the point of attack.  This is common in centers who have to snap the ball in addition to firing out to handle these mamouths.  See \textbf{Hronis Grasu} for a perfect example.
