* Players to watch
** Kevin White, Anthony Miller, James Daniels, Adam Shaheen didn't play.
** Jonathon Bullard 90, Roy Robertson-Harris 95 Might hae the edge here.  Bullard and he got a lot of playing time.
** Tanner Gentry 19 - didn't do much
** Javon Wims making a case for the practice squad
** Jordan Morgan 67 - got pushed around.  Was basically responnsible for "tupped" INT that hit him in the helmet.
** Eric Kush - started at center (Not Hronis Grasu).  Looked good.
** Isaiah Irving and Kylie Fitts both looked OK.  They got pressure.
* Deondre Houston-Carson INT.  They need more turnovers.
* Can't tell much from preseason but I was surprised to see Michael Burton get a lot of attention early in the game.  He's good freinds with Trubisky.  Makes me wonder if they're going to use the full back more this year.  Could have just been giving him exposure as a favor before they release him.
* There was one hit in the endzone where the Bears got called for unnecessary roughness that will terrify coaches all over the league.  Guys had his head up and still got called.

* I may eventually turn this into a post but I thought Iâ€™d just mail it in here for now.

** I was disapointed that Kevin White, Anthony Miller, James Daniels, Adam Shaheen didn't play.  I really wanted a good look at all of them.

** Dion Sims didn't exaxctly cover himself in glory/  He had a miscommunication with Daniel that resulte din an INT and he had an offsides penalty.

** Roy Robertson-Harris and Jonathon Bullard are competing for that DE spot opposite Akiem Hicks and they played a lot last night, especially Bullard.  They even moved inside to tackle in the nickel defense.  I thought they both were solid and they both flashed.  Robertson-Harris got a nice sack and Bullard got some good penetration on a play or two.  Both looked tough to move when they were two gappoing.  So far so good.

** Isaiah Irving and Kylie Fitts both played a lot, especially Fitts.  They're competing with Sma Acho for a job opposite Leonard Floyd.  The both had sacks and falshed some quickness that I liked.  Generally speaking the Bears got a lot of pressure last night.

** Even though Tanner Gentry had a TD catch he didn't do much last light to make me think he's going to make the practice squad.

** On the other hand Javon Wims definitely flashed with some attitude to boot.  He got a good start on making his case for the practice squad.  He's got a lot of size.

** Jordan Morgan played a lot and I was disappointed.  He got better later in the game but he got pushed around early.  He was basically responnsible for "tipped" INT that hit him in the helmet as he got shoved back into the pocket by a bull rush.  But I was watching him even before that and he looked a little ugly.  I'm wondering if he has a future with the team.

** Eric Kush started at center and played a lot.  He looked good.  I would have been surprised if he didn't.  I didn't see Hronis Grasu at all and I'm guessing he's still injured.  His spot with the team is in jeopardy.

** Can't tell much from preseason but I was surprised to see Michael Burton get a lot of attention in the game.  It was probably because they didn't want to expose Trey Burton and Adam Shaheen and they were short on TEs.  But he's good friends with Trubisky. Makes me wonder if they're going to use the fullback more this year.  On the other hand they could have just been giving him exposure as a favor before they release him.

** Lamarr Jackson looked like he belonged.  He was fine.  But he's a
  little like DeSean Watson in that he doens't have much of an arm.
  It was no surprise that his first and, to my memory, only pass
  outside the numbers hung in the air and got intercepted.  If you can
  keep him in the pocket and take away the middle of the field, you
  could cause him trouble.  But keeping him in the pocket is easier
  said than done and taking away th emiddle of the field witht he rules
  being what they are is much, much easier said than done.  So I think
  he's going to be fine.

** I liked the way the new helmet rule was called in the first half.  Guys dipping their heads to initiate contact should be flagged in the modern NFL and I had no problem with it.  

But there was one hit in the endzone by NIck Orr where the Bears got called for the helmet rule that will terrify coaches all over the league.  The guy had his head up and it still got called.  There was another one on a Baltmore player later in the half that was very iffy.

Having said that, these refs have a habit of making their point by calling things tight in the preseason when it comes to points of emphasis and rule changes like this.  They might loosen up and we wont' be talking about it at all by Christmas.  But there's going to be a lot of complaining if they call it during the season like they did in the second half.

**  I wouldn't waste my energy taking sides in the Roquon Smith hold
  out.  The Bears are pretty tight when it comes to stuff like this and its verry likely that what you are hearing right now is coming almost entirely from the
  agent.  Remember that these things are almost always mostly about money - how early the player gets it and in what form.  Everything else is just a negotiating point.

Bottom line, I'm sure there are two sides to this.  They're all
  professionals and this is just the way it goes.  I'd advise fans to
  forget about it as much as possible until Smith hits the field and
  there's something to evaluate with out own eyes.  I know I'm much
  happier for it when I do that.
