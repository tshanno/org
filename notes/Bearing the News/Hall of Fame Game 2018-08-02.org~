* Players to watch
** Kevin White, Anthony Miller, James Daniels, Adam Shaheen didn't play.
** Jonathon Bullard 90, Roy Robertson-Harris 95 Might hae the edge here.  Bullard and he got a lot of playing time.
** Tanner Gentry 19 - didn't do much
** Javon Wims making a case for the practice squad
** Jordan Morgan 67 - got pushed around.  Was basically responnsible for "tupped" INT that hit him in the helmet.
** Eric Kush - started at center (Not Hronis Grasu).  Looked good.
** Isaiah Irving and Kylie Fitts both looked OK.  They got pressure.
* Deondre Houston-Carson INT.  They need more turnovers.
* Can't tell much from preseason but I was surprised to see Michael Burton get a lot of attention early in the game.  He's good freinds with Trubisky.  Makes me wonder if they're going to use the full back more this year.  Could have just been giving him exposure as a favor before they release him.
* Tehre was one hit in the endzone where the Bears got called for unnecessary roughness that will terrify coaches all over the league.  Guys had his head up and still got called.
