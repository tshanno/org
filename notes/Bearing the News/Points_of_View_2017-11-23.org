It must have been
\href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-john-fox-ryan-pace-bears-mailbag-20171122-story.html}{a
pretty good question and answer column from \textbf{Brad Biggs} at the
\textit{Chicago Tribune}} because I've got a lot of comments to make
in my free time this Thanksgiving day:

\begin{itemize}
\item Here's \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-john-fox-ryan-pace-bears-mailbag-20171122-story.html}{question number one}:
  
  \begin{quote}
    Can you explain why \textbf{Tarik Cohen} wasn’t on the field for the final
    drive on Sunday against the Lions? Why do the coaches insist on
    using \textbf{Benny Cunningham}? — Mark A., Milwaukee

    I don’t have a problem with this decision the way some people
    do. If folks want to criticize the coaching staff for some of the
    decisions that have been made, including how personnel has been
    deployed, I think there are more nuanced criticisms that can be
    made. The Bears ran 10 offensive plays in the final possession and
    Cunningham was on the field for all of them. He stayed in as a
    pass blocker on six snaps. He chipped and then released into the
    pattern as a check-down target on one snap and he released from
    the backfield on three snaps. I certainly don’t think it would
    make sense to have Cohen on the field as a pass blocker in that
    situation.

  I tend to agree.

  Biggs
  \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-bears-lions-10-thoughts-brad-biggs-20171120-story.html}{has
    made the point that Cohen is a gadget player} at this point in his
  career and that's what I see as well.  I've had a hard time
  understanding the ciriticsm of the Bears from both fans and media
  aimed at how they are playing him.

  To some extent the league has caught up to Cohen.  He really hasn't
  shown that much once the league took away his cut back lanes.  Last
  game he had 9 carries for 44 yards (4.9 ypc), his best game in many
  weeks.  But Jordan Howard had 15 carries for 125 yards (8.3 ypc).
  Its hard to take Howard off the field as a runner at this point and,
  as Biggs points out, the 5'6'' Cohen is unlikely to ever be the kind
  of pass blocker that you can leave in when you are expecting the
  blitz.  He certainly isn't right now.

  There are plenty of things to worry about as Bears fans right now.
  How they are using Cohen is so far down the list it should barely
  register.

  
\item Here's \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-john-fox-ryan-pace-bears-mailbag-20171122-story.html}{another good question}:

  \begin{quote}
    Why is \textbf{John Fox} on the hot seat while \textbf{Ryan Pace}’s job appears
    safe? The Bears have finished last for his entire tenure and look
    likely to finish last this year as well. The roster has few
    playmakers, an abysmal receiving corps, a secondary in need of a
    rebuild and a limited pass rush. Does anyone believe a different
    coach would get much better results with this roster? While Pace
    was not handed much in terms of a roster, the NFL operates on a
    much shorter cycle than other sports, and after 2 1/2 years a
    turnaround has not happened and does not appear imminent. In my
    opinion much of the goodwill centers around optimism you can still
    project onto Mitch Trubisky. But Pace gave up enormous value to
    get him and that already appears to be a mistake (Deshaun
    Watson). — Tim M., Parts Unknown

    I don’t believe Pace has been unscathed when it comes to criticism
    and commentary this season. Fox is front and center every week and
    that certainly makes him an easier target for most people.
  \end{quote}

  I actually
  \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-free-agents-kevin-white-biggs-bears-mailbag-20170517-story.html}{asked
    a variation of this question back in May} and I note that \textbf{Mike Mulligan}, also at the \textit{Tribune} \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-mulligan-ryan-pace-20171121-story.html}{did just this morning as well}.

  I continue to have a
  tough time with the idea that Fox cold be fired while Pace
  remains. How can you hold a coach responsible for losing without
  holding the person who supplied him with the players equally so?
  Especially in this case where only mediocre free agents and little
  immediate help in the draft was added to a 3-13 team?

  I really don't want to see either of these guys go.  At least not
  before we see if there's any progress before the end of the season.
  But my sense of justice tells me that Fox will getting a bit of a
  raw deal if he's fired while Pace stays.

  
\item Here's \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-john-fox-ryan-pace-bears-mailbag-20171122-story.html}{another one}:

  \begin{quote}
    What are your thoughts on the Bears drafting another quarter back next year? — @bearsdfense

    I’m guessing a guy with the Twitter handle BearsDfense would be
    happier if they used their draft picks on wide receivers,
    defensive backs, outside linebackers and maybe some linemen. I’d
    be stunned if they drafted a quarterback in 2018 and you should be
    too.
  \end{quote}

  I don't think I'd go that far.  The odds of \textbf{Mike Glennon} and \textbf{Mark
  Sanchez} returning aren't great.  Theyll sign a vertan backup of
  some type, for sure but it wouldn't surprise me to see the Beas use
  a mid-to-late round pick on a guy that they like to develop as a
  third quarterback.

\item \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-john-fox-ryan-pace-bears-mailbag-20171122-story.html}{And again}:

  \begin{quote}
    What do you think the defensive backfield looks like next year? — @jpzimm

    That’s a good question... The burning question is what happens at
    cornerback? \textbf{Prince Amukamara} and \textbf{Kyle Fuller} are
    in contract seasons and the Bears can move on from \textbf{Marcus
      Cooper} before a roster bonus is due to him in March. So as I
    wrote this past Sunday, all three are really in a contract
    year. My hunch is Fuller will want to explore the open market and
    see what is out there. He’s played OK this season with some ups
    and downs. Amukamara has been steady and has gotten a lot less
    action than Fuller. Two pass interference calls against him the
    last two weeks aren’t good but that happens. Cooper looks like
    he’s lacking confidence. What’s the solution? I think the Bears
    need to use a high draft pick (think first two rounds) on a
    cornerback, they need to sign one in free agency and come up with
    a third option. This will be an offseason project for sure.
  \end{quote}

  If Amukamara is amenable, the Bears should be moving to try to sign
  him for a reasonable price right now before he hits the open market.
  Despite his continued drought in terms of generating turnovers, he's
  been their best cover corner.  My guess is that they let Cooper go.

  Fuller has been better than expected but hasn't looked good the last
  couple weeks and his tacking is suspect.  His future with the Bears
  probably depends a lot on how he finishes the seson.  As it is, they
  might try to sign him on the cheap but why would he accept that kind
  of contract with them when he could get a fresh start for the same
  money somewhere else?
  
\item Here's \href{http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-john-fox-ryan-pace-bears-mailbag-20171122-story.html}{the last one I want to address}:
  \begin{quote}
    With the injury to \textbf{Leonard Floyd} and injury history of \textbf{Pernell
    McPhee}, the Bears appear to be lacking impact pash rushers yet
    again. Do you believe the Bears cut McPhee to save the \$7 million
    against the cap in the offseason? Who are impact pass rushers the
    Bears may consider in draft and free agency? — @beardown7878

    I don’t think the right knee injury Floyd suffered in the fourth
    quarter of Sunday’s loss to the Lions has anything to do with what
    the club will decide to do with McPhee, who turns 29 next
    month. McPhee’s balky knees will make it difficult, in my opinion,
    for the Bears to consider him part of the future plan. He has a
    base salary of \$7.2 million in 2018 with a \$200,000 roster bonus
    due June 1 and a \$175,000 workout bonus. The delayed roster bonus
    would give the Bears a little time to make a decision but I don’t
    know that the Bears will need that much time to filter through
    this one. McPhee is a part-time player at this point and has
    struggled with the knees since midway through the 2015 season.
\end{quote}

Yeah, I can't see the Bears paying this kind of money for McPhee.  One
thing that could do is ask him to take a pay cut.  McPhee has
occasionally provided a boost in spurts at critical times in the game.
That certianly doesn't make him owrth \$7 million.  But he might still
get as much or more from the Bears as a part time player than he would
on the open market.

\item The Denver Broncos
  \href{http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/article186205098.html}{fired
    offensive coordinator \textbf{Mike McCoy}} this week.  Apparenty
  general manager \textbf{John Elway}
  \href{http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/11/23/bill-musgrave-wants-cleaner-offensive-approach-for-broncos/}{felt
    that the offense was too complex}.

  The firing makes me wonder if head coach \textbf{John Fox} would
  conside hiring McCoy in some capacity.  McCoy was the offensive
  coordinator and quarterback coach for the Broncos from 2009-2012.
  In 2009 Broncos QB Kyle Orton enjoyed a career year under McCoy and
  in 2010 the Broncos ranked seventh in passing and Orton ranked
  fourth in the league in passing yards per game. McCoy adapted to
  accommodate Tim Tebow's skill-set in 2011.

  It wouldn't be the first time the Bears showed interest in McCoy.
  They asked the Broncos for permission to interview McCoy for the
  head coach position in 2012 after they fired \textbf{Lovie Smith}.

  \textbf{Dowell Loggains} hasn't really done anything to deserve to
  be fired but you wonder if the future of \textbf{Mitch Trubisky}
  might be in better hands with McCoy as the quarterback coach over
  the relatively inexperienced \textbf{Dave Ragone}.

\end{itemize}
