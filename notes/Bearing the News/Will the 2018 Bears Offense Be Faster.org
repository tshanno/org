\textbf{Lorin Cox} at \textit{USA Today} \href{https://bearswire.usatoday.com/2018/06/22/chicago-bears-offense-pace-matt-nagy-john-fox/}{doesn't think the Bears offense will be any quicker to snap the ball this year}.

\begin{quote}
  Last year under \textbf{John Fox} and offensive coordinator \textbf{Dowell Loggains}, the Bears’ offense was the NFL’s slowest in terms of the time it took to snap the ball, \href{https://www.footballoutsiders.com/index.php?q=stats/pacestats}{according to Football Outsiders} (\href{https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/6/21/17486716/weird-nfl-stats-2018}{via The Ringer}).

However, [new Bears head coach \textbf{Matt}] \textbf{Nagy}’s Kansas City Chiefs were actually the second-slowest to snap the ball, just ahead of the Bears.

It's worth remembering that Nagy hired former Oregon head coach \textbf{Mark Helfrich} to help bring some spread concepts to the offense.  Along with that may be a renewed commitment to a hurry up offense, at least in spots.  Indeed, this is something that Nagy, himself, has said he'd like to do depending upon the opponent.

Are we going to see the kind of speed offense that Helfrich ran at Oregon?  No.  But Nagy wouldn't have hired him unless they has a simpatico vision for how the offense would run and I wouldn't be at all surprised if Nagy brought the no huddle to the offense more than his mentor, \textbf{Andy Reid} did in Kansas City.
