\textbf{Defense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Saints are a really nice offensive ball club that came out
  executing.  They did a nice ob of mixing it up on the Bears defense.
\item It all started with the running game and the screen game with the Saints.  Once they established those two plays, they did a nice job of playing on the defense's reactions to take maximum advantage of their success.  The Bears appeared to be very conscious of both.
\item The Bears defense did itself no favors today as there was poor tacking all over the field.  You can't get away with that with an offense that is hitting on all cylinders.
\item All of that poor tacking resulted in some atypical big plays.  Those were what really hurt today as much as anything else.
\item One thing you notice about the Saints is how well they block downfield.  Its now those screen plays run.
\item Akiem Hicks had another good game.  He was drawing a lot of
  double teams and still had a big effect on the game.  He's
  certainly not slowing down after getting that big contract.
\item Hicks and Leonard Floyd did a good job of getting some pressure
  on Brees.  Nice to see Floyd blossoming.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Offense}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Saints came out and did exactly like you'd expect.  They stacked the line of scrimmage and made the Bears beat them with the pass.
\item The Saints did a good job of pressing the Bears wide receivers off the line of scrimmage.  They had a tough time getting open.
\item I thought Kenny Vaccaro stuck out as having a particularly good
  game with the Saints.  They were crashing the line of scrimmage and
  blitzing to stop Jordan Howard and Mitch Trubisky and that seems to
  be something he excels at.
\item The Bears are having a tough time with that outside zone run
  play.  Teams are crashing the line of scrimmage and getting
  penetration on it and stopping it cold.  They had better luck
  running up the middle.
\item The receivers did come alive a little more today (5 catches for
  115 yards between Tre McBride and Kendall Wright).  McBride had a big 40
  yard reception to set up the Bears field goal in the first half.
  The Bears got them with the play action, something I think we'd all
  like to see happen more.
\item I thought the Bears did a decent job of running up the middle.
  It was that outside zone stretch play mentioned above that wasn't
  working well.
\item I thought the Bears did a better job of passing starting late in
    the second quarter.  The wide receivers had thier best game all year.

    Interestingly, Trubisky appears to be picking his targets before
    the snap rather than reading the field afterwards.  He's getting
    away with it for now.
\item Trubisky who took yet another sack near the end of the first
  half to make a Connor Barth field goal about 10 yards longer.  Barth
  missed it.  That's two weeks in a row.  He has to stop doing that.
\item Trubisky is also still having trouble picking up the backside
  blitz.  Not a great surprise I guess but he needs to learn quickly.
\item Would have liked to have seen Trubisky be a little more accurate
  today.  Admittedly he wa probably trying hard to put th eball only
  where the receiver could catch it.  But he missed some big passes
  that we were told based upon what he did in college that he wouldn't
  miss.
\item On the positive side, Trubisky threw a tremendous pass to Zack
  Miller for the Bears touchdown in the third quarter.  \textup{And it was a touchdown}.
\item Darned shame to see Miller get injured on that play.  Story of
  his career.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Miscellaneous}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Justin Kutcher and Chris Spielman were your announcing team.  give it up for Spielman who did a nice job.  He brought a perspective to the game that was a bit different in a land of former quarterbacks as color men.  Case in point:  he taught us that when the offensive linemen aren't square to the line of scrimmage it's not an outside zone running play but a bootleg to the opposite side.  He did a nice job peppering the game with such points.
\item Connor Barth missed a field goal from 45 yards at the end of the
  second half.  He wasn't helped by Trubisky who took yet another sack
  to make that field goal about 10 or so more yards.  He has to stop
  doing that.

  Tarik Cohen took the ball on a punt and he hesitated rather than
  just running up field.  The Saints player on the coverage was going
  full steam and buried him.  He has to stop that jittering and just
  go.
  
\item An offside on Kyle Fuller on a field goal attempt gave
    Saints a first down.  That resulted in a touchdown. That was a bad
    one.  But overall I don't think the Bears committed too may
    penalties today.
  \item Drops weren't a factor today but Jordan Howard had a terrible
    one near the goal line late in the fourth quarter.
  \item The Bears won the turnover battle by getting two fumbles in the
    fourth quarter that kept them in the game.  
  \item They say that every game comes down to just a few plays.  Boy,
    was that true today.  Take the four points the Bears lost on Kyle
    Fuller's offside call that allowed the Saints to get a touchdown
    instead of a field goal in the first quarter, the three points
    Trubisky arguably cost the Bears by taking a sack and moving the
    Bears back on a first half missed field goal and the four points
    the referees cost them by taking away Miller's touchdown and you'd
    have the Bears right in the middle of this game.

  The Bears actually didn't playbadly.  Their tackling was poor
  and that cost them a great deal but they weren't committing
  penalties, they weren't dropping the ball and they once again won
  the turnover battle.

  Having said all of that, I still think the better team won today.
  But the Bears hung tough with a team that was really playing well.
  Every game I think we see a little more hope for the future.  Just
  another good draft or two and maybe they'll be competitive with
  anyone.

    the run with an extra guy in the box.}

\item \textsl{Tre McBride with a big reception.  40 yards.  Got them with the play action.}
\item \textsl{McBride needed to ge tinto the endzone there.  Bears are getting into the red zone and there's no where to go.  They can't use the play acton because there isn't enough field and they don't have the recievers to get open on a short field otherwise.  Saints have nine defenders in the box and they have no respect for the pass.  Nor should they.}
\item \textsl{second quarter}
\item \textsl{Saints are attacking the Bear soutside.  Bears dont' 'have the speed to keep up.}
\item \textsl{Bears are getting a little pressure on Brees.}

\item \textsl{Trubisky still having trouble picking up the backside blitz.}
\item \textsl{Saints running the Bears defense ragged.  Really doing a good job of spreading the ball around and attacking all over the field.  But it starts with the run game and the screen game.  Bears have to tackle.}
\item \textsl{Bears doing a better job of passing late in the second quarter.
  Interestingly, Trubisky appears to be picking his targets before the
