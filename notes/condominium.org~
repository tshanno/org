***** Removed garbage disposal.  I decided not to replace it.
***** Unclogged drain.
***** Will bill me later.  He said to sit down before I opened it but less than $1000.

**** He told me the garbage disposal was shot and not just because it was leaking.  I guess the bearings were bad.  He removed the broken garbage disposal and I told him to put in a simple drain in its place - I never used it anyway.

Repair man came some time between 9 and 9:30.

He said that the signal was low but that wasn't the major problem.  They'll take care of that later because the problem  is outside the building.

Apparently the splitter was bad and the TiVO was broken.  He replaced the box.  I lost all of my recordings but no big deal.
