* [[https://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/struggling-in-medical-school.719842/][Most importantly keep yourself mentally healthy. Don't get too down on yourself. Everyone in your class was a great student in college and half of them will be in the bottom half in medical school. If you find that you are passing but not as good as you wanted to be, maybe you should make peace with that (unless your heart is set on an incredibly competitive field).]
* i also have trouble with the vast amount of material. my best advice to you is to focus your energy on high yield materials. get board review books an read the relevant section before your exam. talk to your classmates who are doing really well and ask them which areas are really important to know cold. getting A's is somewhat a game, and some people are just better at figuring out what to do . and definitely talk with your professors, they will give you clues about which concepts are key for exams and practice.
*** at the beginning of a given subject, grab a high yield or BRS book related to the topic.

** I've found that making flashcards on the computer has been massively helpful in all the memorization required in med school.

** DO NOT:
*** Students therefore often
try to double down on the following three old, ineffective strategies:
1. Spend more time tha·n peers. The time demands of medical school leave little extra time for success in this strategy;
2. Re-writing notes and/or creating note cards. This passive learning tool does not demand manipulation, building of connections, or critical thinking; and finally
3. Reading, re-reading, reviewing. Although critical for integration of concepts, these three "R's" cannot be successfully employed to manage the entire volume of material in the medical curriculum. There is simply not enough time.
** Review books
*** a given learning event (lecture, chapter in a book, etc.) and store the all-important details. It is reasonable to speculate that struggling students almost have to make a choice regarding framework versus details, and after they take the first detail- rich exam, they opt to focus on details. These details will either
fail to be encoded into memory or not be accessible in the future due to the lack of the organizational framework. These problems can be addressed by learning how to first quickly construct the organizational framework before housing details.

** According to *Caven Mcloughlin, Ph.D.*, these problems manifest themselves in one of three areas: information organization, planning processing, or test preparation.

of Utah School of Medicine have

helping medical students develop
an effective method of studying. - [[/Users/tshanno/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Preview/Documents/Recommended Student Stdy Blogs.png]]

** Not putting in the time because they got by as undergrads
** Too many personal demands
** Need to convince them to get help - procrastination is the enemy of good scholarship
** Knowledge is the awareness of facts. But erudition, or deep knowledge, is the understanding of how facts relate to other facts. The best doctors I know, invest maximum energy in erudition. They don’t let any information remain disconnected. They pull all facts together. After all, the best way to stabilize a fact in your brain is to tie it to other facts, or images, or sounds.
*** Supports the notion that review books can be used to get overall structure and relationships

** Passive reading of pages of text or “going over” notes (even with a highlighter) and hoping to absorb the information is very inefficient – if you have enough time, it will eventually work, but it usually isn’t adequate for the fire hose.

Changing a habit that has worked for many years isn’t easy, so don’t be surprised if you need to hear the same things many times – and don’t be afraid to ask to hear it again!
** Four active processes will be used in the steps of any active study pattern, and any study time that does not involve one or more of these steps is almost certainly passive and inefficient!
*** 1)   Identifying the important information – answering the eternal question of “what’s important here?”

1) Organizing the information – create a framework that facilitates memorization and emphasizes the connections within the material needed for application questions, e.g., for differential diagnosis.

2) Memorizing the information – do this in pieces along the way and review it in pieces – much easier!

3) Applying the information to more complex situations – practice this before the exam.
