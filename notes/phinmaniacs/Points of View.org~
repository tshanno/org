\item Armando Salguero  \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article226425485.html}{comments upon the addition of Reggie McKenzie as a ``senior personnel executive''}.

  \begin{quote}
    ``[W]hat’s not to like?

``McKenzie, 56, comes with seven seasons of experience as the Oakland Raiders’ general manager and before that he was part of the Green Bay Packers front office that helped to re-establish that franchise among the NFL’s elite.

``McKenzie will not be working out of the Dolphins headquarters in Davie fulltime. It’s not even likely he’ll be moving to the area.

``But his advice and eye for talent might be useful as the Dolphins move forward in the rebuilding of the franchise.

``The problem with this?

``Well, McKenzie’s record in Oakland was inconsistent.''
\end{quote}

Indeed it was as Salguero goes on to document.  In fact, ``inconsistent'' might be kind.  He basically had one good draft with them.

\href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-hyde-caldwell-dolphins-20190215-story.html}{A lot has been made} of the fact that, though the Dolphins have mainly served youth when hiring their head coach and coordinators, they have hired experience to help them.  Probably too much.

I'm as happy as anyone that they hired Jim Caldwell as the assistant head coach but it was mostly because they needed someone to coach whichever quarterback they eventually draft.  I expect him to have his say but the game plan is still mostly going to have to come from offensive coordinator Chad O'Shea.

Ditto McKensie.  Its nice to have some validaton from the voice of experience but Chris Grier has been the general manager watching Mike Tannenbaum run the team since 2016.  \href{https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/dolphins-have-the-right-man-in-grier-and-other-points-of-view}{The talent that he's drafted without interference from Adam Gase has turned out to be pretty good}.  He doesn't need McKensie to tell him who to draft and the bet here is that if Grier is the man we think he should be, that simply wouldn't happen anyway.
