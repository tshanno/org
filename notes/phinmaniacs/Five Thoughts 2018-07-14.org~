\item I noted comments from Armando Salguero at the \textit{Miami Herald} earlier in the spring when he  \href{http://w}ww.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article210122254.html}{suggested that} with the addition of free safety Minkah Fitzpatrick the Dolphins could play a unique nickel package.

``[P]erhaps the Dolphins utilize three safeties and only one linebacker in sub packages -- with Fitzpatrick, Reshad Jones, T.J. McDonald and the best coverage linebacker the Dolphins have at the time on the field all at once,'' Salguero writes.

My own thoughts are along this line but are more conventional.  What I envision the Dolphins doing is playing more of what is known as the ``Big Nickel''.  This is a standard nickel defense with an extra safety rather than an extra cornerback.  The defense has become more and more popular over the last few years.  Fitzpatrick offers the kind of versatility that you need in a third safety to be able to do this.

In any case, its obvious that defensive coordinator Matt Burke has some interesting chess pieces to work with.  Here's hoping he does a better job this year of utilizing them.
\item One of the things that's worrying me about the 2018 Dolphins is the state of their offensive line.  \textit{Pro Football Focus} \href{https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-ranking-all-32-offensive-lines-from-the-2017-nfl-season
  }{rated it 29th in the league in 2017} with some justification.

  \begin{quote}
    The Dolphins’ offensive line had a disappointing season, especially considering the unit features three former first-round picks and only one of them – right tackle Ja’Wuan James – has performed at an NFL starter level. However, when it comes to pass protection, the unit played relatively well, which led to the sixth-highest pass-blocking efficiency rating (81.7) in the NFL as they allowed just 153 total pressures on 646 passing plays. The bigger issues came in the running game where Miami’s offensive line struggled mightily and all linemen graded poorly. Consequently, Miami’s running backs averaged just 0.59 yards before contact, which was last in the NFL by a wide margin (Detroit was second to last with 0.96 yards) and well below the NFL average of 1.56 yards before contact.

  PFF's ranking \href{https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-nfl-offensive-line-rankings-all-32-teams-units-entering-2018}{rose to 20th} as it considered the state of the offensive lines entering 2018.  The sighted the addition of Josh Sitton at the guard position as the reason for this.  And its true that Sitton will improve the pass protection.  He might also \href{http://dailydolphin.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2018/05/25/laremy-tunsil-josh-sitton-cohesive-on-left-side-of-miami-dolphins-o-line/}{help to stabilize Laremy Tunsil at left tackle}.  But, as mentioned in the quote above, the pass protection wasn't really the issue last year.  It was the run blocking that was abysmal and the 32 year old Sitton isn't going to make that much better.
  
\item On the positive side for the running game, I love the addition of Frank Gore at running back.  Even though I didn't consider the position to be a weakness in 2017, Gore will improve the depth and the veteran presence certainly can't hurt in a situation where head coach Adam Gase is trying to improve the team culture.

  Executive Vice President of Football Operations Mike Tannenbaum loves to take a chance on veterans like Julius Thomas, Arian Foster and Mario Williams and these players almost never work out.  But I'm on board with this one.  Gore has had 12 consecutive seasons with at least 1,000 yards from scrimmage.  He's going to perform.
\item Much has been made about how \href{http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article211639439.html]]}{the Dolphins believe that Ryan Tannehill is as durable as ever coming off of his knee injury}.  But durability isn't really the major concern.  The potential problem is Tannehill's mental state.

  Whenever I think of quarterbacks and knee injuries I think of Carson Palmer.  Palmer sustained a devastating injury during the 2005 campaign with the Bengals \href{http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2486170}{one that was admittedly much worse than Tannehill's}.  Palmer was never the same after that not because the knee didn't heal but because he was constantly afraid that an incoming defensive lineman would hit him and cause another similar injury.

  I don't have a single doubt that after surgery and rehabilitation, Tannehill's knee will be fine.  Indeed, he says its fine.  So if that's true, why is he still wearing a brace and why is he gong to continue to do so throughout the season?

  The major question for Tannehill is whether he can forget about the knee and focus on the game.  If he can, he'll be the same top 17 or 18 quarterback he's always been and the Dolphins will have a chance to compete.  If he can't, its going to be a miserable season.
