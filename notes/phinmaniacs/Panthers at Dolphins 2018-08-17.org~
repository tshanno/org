Dolphins on offense
Brock Osweiler 8 Not particularly accurate.
David Fales 9  Threw high and in front of Owusu then behind 81 for an INT.  Behind 82 on 4th and 4 later in the quarter though it was har dto tell if it was supposed to be a back shoulder throw.
Bryce Petty 14
Ryan Tannehil 17 looked really sharp.  Good accuracy.  Made the reads.  Threw with authority.

Kallen Ballage 33

Daniel Kilgore 67 - looks good.  Appear to be able to run block pretty well.  Did have a tough time with one block on a screen play but it looked like a pretty good play by the defender.
Laremy Tunsil 78

Mike Gesicki 86
Francis Owusu 82
Devante Parker 11
Albery Wilson 15


Dolphins on Defense
Jerome Baker 55
Raekwon McMillan 52 - got blocked solidly out of the hole on the McCaffry touchdown.  He's got a tough time taking on blocks but he has good range which he frequenltly shoed.  It looked like he failed to pick up TE Ian Thomas on the TD near the end of the second half.

Davon Godchaux 56
Charles Harris 90

Delay of game on third and goal from the 9 in first quarter

Robert Quinn with two sacks.

Drew MOrgan muffed a punt at the bginning of the 2nd quarter.

Miami showed a lot of blitzes.  They weren't particularly effective.

INT MAurice Smith 3rd quarter.  Fales take over at teh 10.  He made a nice pass to the back of the end zone but Carroo couldn't get a second foot down.  A better WR might have gotten it done.






Stokc up:

Ryan Tannehill looked very sharp in Just short of 2 quarters worth of work.  He was 14 of 17 for 100 yards as he dropped back, read the field and delivered the ball reasonably accurately to the open receiver.  His passer rating for the night was a solid 91.2

Robert Quinn - The free agent signee from Los Angeles made Mike Tannenbaum and Chris Greer look good as he showed both quickness and power while rushing off of the edge.  Quinn will be a handful for any offensive tackle in the league one-on-one if he keeps playing like he did against the Panthers.

Daniel Kilgore

Stock Down

Raekwon McMillan is effectively a rookie and though he was improved over his debut performance last week, he sill looks like one as he was vary incosistent on the night.  McMillan shows excellent range and he frequently makes good, quick reads that get him in position to make plays from sideline to sideline.  You can see why the Dolphins liked him when they drafted him in the second round in 2017 before an injury derailed his season.  But McMillan had trouble taking on and getting off of blocks and was solidly sealed out of the hole on the Christian McCaffry's 71 yard touchdown run in the first quarter.  It also appeared that he failed to pick up TE Ian Thomas in coverage on a 27 yard touchdown pass near the end of the first half.
