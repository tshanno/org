* Ten Post-Draft Dolphins Thoughts
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Dolphins were very pleased with their first round acquisition, Minka Fitzpatrick, and rightfully so.

  “I didn’t expect Minkah to be there, to be honest with you, for the first pick,” \href{http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-draft-20180428-story.html}{general manager Chris Grier said.}  ”For me, he was probably — however you put it — one of the top five or six players in this draft. As we got calls after the pick, other teams kept calling us telling us, ‘He was in our top five players in the draft.’ For us, the value at that point was surprising that he was there.”

  There were really only three no-brainer picks in this draft:  running back Saquon Barkley, defensive end Bradly Chubb and offensive guard Quenton Nelson.  All went very early.

  Below those three, you could make a case for any of the top prospects remaing going anywhere down to the roughly the 15th pick.  But of that remaining group, Fitzpatrick had easily the highest floor.  A versatile performer, Fitzpatrick could play safety or cornerback.  He has the range and coverage skills to be an excellent free safety and could be a valuable chess peice for defensive coordinator Matt Burke.
  
\item  On the down side, the blame for needing to draft a safety after previously addressing the position last year lies squarely on the shoulders of executive vice president of football operations Mike Tannenbaum.  Tannenbaum has a bad habit of being enamoured with ``name'' players and he did it again in this situation.  He jumped at the chance to acquire T.J. McDonald from the Rams without properly evaluating his fit beside All-Pro Rashad Jones.  Both should be strong safties and the two didn't work well together last year.

  Tannenbaum has to stop chasing names and has to give more thought to how both age and fit determine whether a player is right for the Dolphins roster.
  
\item Mike Gesicki and Durhame Graham were also excellent fits for the Dolphins and a good value where they drafted them, especially Gesicki who could have gone in the first round.  Miami lost tight ends Julius Thomas and Anthony Fasano and Dion SImms the year before last.

  This was a position of need and stocking young players who both a guy who could catch the ball in Gesicki and block in Graham was a necessary step to refilling that spot on the roster.  Gesicki could contribute right away.
  
\item The Dolphins have one massive hole in their roster which they did not address:  defensive tackle.  Tannenbaum siad they're happy with what they have at the position and, fair enough, 2017 5th round pick Davon Godchaux shows promise.  But depending upon Jordan Phillips to fill the void on the other side is a recipe for disaster.

  I simply cannot understand this organization's stubborn insistence that Phillips will eventually develop the consistency needed to start and play at a competant level in what will now be his fourth year on the team.  These delusions that this 2015 second round pick is anything be a situational backup are disturbing.  Sticking with your draft choices just because they're your draft choices in the face of years of evidence that they simply can't play is the bad look for this front office at a time when the owner is reportedly losing patience with the franchise's directon.

  I can't imagine a well-run, elite frachise sticking with Phillips year after year with a faith bordering on the religious that he'll finally  fulfill what they say is his potential.

  It is not an exaggeration to say that Ndamkong Suh literally stopped the run over the entire half of whichever side of the offensive line he was on in the face of constant double teams.  And the Dolphins still were below average to poor stopping the run in recent years.  Without him now and without an adequate replacement, the problem is going to be even more acute.  The effect of losing those double teams on the inside is going to hurt Cameron Wake's sack production as well.

  Even with the addition of FItzpatrick, this defense took a step back in the off season.
