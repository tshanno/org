* [[https://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/struggling-in-medical-school.719842/][Most importantly keep yourself mentally healthy. Don't get too down on yourself. Everyone in your class was a great student in college and half of them will be in the bottom half in medical school. If you find that you are passing but not as good as you wanted to be, maybe you should make peace with that (unless your heart is set on an incredibly competitive field).]
* i also have trouble with the vast amount of material. my best advice to you is to focus your energy on high yield materials. get board review books an read the relevant section before your exam. talk to your classmates who are doing really well and ask them which areas are really important to know cold. getting A's is somewhat a game, and some people are just better at figuring out what to do . and definitely talk with your professors, they will give you clues about which concepts are key for exams and practice.
*** at the beginning of a given subject, grab a high yield or BRS book related to the topic.
** tutors
** I've found that making flashcards on the computer has been massively helpful in all the memorization required in med school.
