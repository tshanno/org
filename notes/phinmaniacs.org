I agree with all of this.  Allen is a little old at 29.

2. The Dolphins’ signing of tight end Dwayne Allen says: (a) new offensive coordinator Chad O’Shea liked Allen in New England; (b) they’re not happy with blocking tight ends like fourth-round pick Durham Smythe or Nick O’Leary; c) they’re not going to ask Mike Gesicki to be an in-line blocker anymore. There’s also a larger question of whether a team that keeps getting accused of tanking would spend two years and $7 million on a role-playing tight end. Answer: They wouldn’t. Plus, if you’re tanking you say you are doing that like the Cleveland Browns and Philadephia 76ers did.

Why did the Eagles let him go?  Immature.

3. New England is up to its wily ways again by signing Michael Bennett for $7.5 million a year and, probably waving good-bye to Trey Flowers in free agency. Flowers is expected to get a deal of at least $15 million, perhaps from the Dolphins and former Patriots defensive coach Brian Flores. The Dolphins are interested, and I wrote about the possibility a few days ago. But that’s the game the Patriots play — finding cheaper talent of equal play (if not age. Bennett is 33, Flowers is 25)

** CANCELED [#C] [[https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-devante-parker-20190312-story.html]] Miami was exploring free-agent receivers like Phillip Dorsett and Chris Hogan, players who have ties to South Florida and worked under new Dolphins offensive coordinator Chad O’Shea when they were all with the New England Patriots.

See which players are on the move as the Miami Dolphins continue to revamp their roster in free agency.

(Keven Lerner, Kenny Rosarion)
Dorsett, a former St. Thomas Aquinas High star who was a standout receiver at the University of Miami, has caught 95 passes for 1,237 yards and six touchdowns in his first four seasons. He’s started four of the 32 games he played for the Patriots the past two seasons.

Hogan, a slot receiver the Dolphins had in training camp in 2012, has 194 receptions for 2,610 yards and 18 touchdowns in his seven NFL seasons.

Retaining Parker decreases the odds of Miami signing either player. But it’s possible that the Dolphins could add another receiver or two in the third wave of free agency, or the NFL draft in April.

Hogan is 30 years old. Neither of these guys were great options and by keeping Parker they increase the compensatory picks from the loss of James
** CANCELED [#C] [[https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-eric-rowe-20190313-story.html]] This looks like a reasonable signing. Rowe is only 26. They’re going to want to sink their money at the position into Howard.

That can’t be the former Dolphins third-round pick in 2014, can it? The one who couldn’t play guard or tackle? Who wasn’t released until the 2016 season simply because new coach Adam Gase, against the personnel department’s advice, offered everyone a fresh start?

Agreed. I wouldn’t want that guy protecting my qb. I have doubts about what’s going on in gb. Amos?

It either becomes The Billy Turner Story told with a first-round pick whose career gets resuscitated with a new coaching staff.

Or — and here’s my guess — it’s proof that all the questions following Parker out of college don’t disappear after four NFL years. Injury issues. System issues. Role issues. It all led to just nine touchdowns in four years in which he often had a feature role — and just two touchdowns the past two years.

Goes with Parker point.

Omar Kelly and Dave Hyde \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/xs-and-omar/116466423-132.html}{discuss what they would need to see this year to be convinced that Josh Rosen is the quarterback of the future (at the 5:00 mark)}.

Kelly's initial answer was ``7 wins''.  :eye roll:  Hyde's more reasonable response was ``You'll know it when you see it''.

A couple things here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In fairness, Kelly immediately started to back off his ridiculous response.  Seven wins on a team with more holes than answers is absurd.  But it does show you what his attitude towards this situation is.  Despite \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-kelly-column-20190430-story.html}{claiming otherwise}, he's determined not to like the Rosen experiment.

  I'm not saying that I mind that.  Like every reporter, no matter who he is, Kelly is welcome to his opinion.  No reporters, no matter how hard they try, can completely suppress those opinions when they write their articles.  And Kelly isn't just acting as a beat reporter.  He's also a columnist where he is actually paid to express that opinion (whether beat reporters should also be allowed to be columnists is a topic for another day).

  Nevertheless, this is something that needs to be born in mind when you read his articles.  They're going to be biased and an informed reader is going to have to compensate mentally for that.
  
\item Neither of these guys is right.  The truth is, with the Dolphins roster constructed the way it is, no one on the outside is really going to know whether Rosen is the answer.  It's not going to be a good year.  Peyton Manning won 1 game his rookie season.  I think we can all agree he wasn't a bad quarterback.

  What people not directly associated with the team are going to have to do is have faith that the coaches know what they're dong and that they'll be able to properly evaluate Rosen from the inside.  They're the ones in the locker room.  They're watching the film.  They'll know how Rosen responds to coaching.  They'll know his strengths and weaknesses to some extent independent of the talent around him.

  We'll be convinced that Rosen is the answer when we find out whether the Dolphins take a quarterback high in the 2020 draft.  Until then, keeping an open mind is really all you can do.

Armando Salguero \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article229939589.html}{separates spin vs. fact about the Dolphins draft}:

\begin{quote}
  ``Narrative: The Dolphins trade down in the second round was part of Miami’s plan to land Rosen.

``Mando verdict: Not only is this spin, it is demonstrably untrue.

``We understand that from general manager Chris Grier himself. From the Dolphins’ news conference at the end of the draft Saturday:

``Question: Were there discussions at pick 48? Did you have to trade back from 48 to make that [Rosen] trade happen in your mind, to make the numbers add up?

``Answer: 'No. The Cardinals were steadfast in what they wanted for it and they were pretty up front with all of the teams. We hadn’t really talked to them until right at the start of the draft, and I think that’s when they started contacting everyone that might be involved. As we went through, we had talked throughout the day a little bit here and there and we finally got to a point where we were comfortable in making a pick. In terms of picking up, for us, it was huge to get the second-round pick in 2020, with the Saints when we made that trade. Regardless of what was there, we were going to make that trade to get the second-round pick. We went into the draft trying to find either another first or second-round pick in 2020.'

``In one-on-one phone interviews served up by the Dolphins media relations department for a couple of national writers, Grier told both Monday Morning quarterback and Football Morning in America that the two were not connected. And he told FMIA that reports of a deal with Arizona being done earlier that somehow guaranteed a trade for Rosen after Miami traded down were wrong.''
\end{quote}

Salguero makes a lot of good points in this article but that one falls flat.

Salguearo's point is that the Dolphins made the trade not knowing if they could swing a deal for Rosen with the 62nd overall pick or not.  No deal was in place.  I have absolutely no trouble believing that.

At the same time, Salguero, perhaps purposely, misses the point.  The fact that the Dolphins felt good making the trade even if Rosen didn't come with it doesn't mean that they didn't have a potential Rosen deal in mind when they made it.  In fact, given that they were already in discussions and thought the 48th pick was too high but obviously felt the 62nd wouldn't be, it would be foolish not to assume that they didn't.

Whether the Dolphins were willing to stand on this trade without a Rosen deal or not, the end result is the same.  They basically \href{https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/miami-dolphins-post-draft-points-of-view}{traded back into the third round and added a fourth round pick to make this happen}.  Intent aside, that was the end result of their maneuvering and that is the bottom line.

Any other conclusion is just spin.

The Sun-Sentinel does \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/sfl-star-nfl-qbs-whose-first-years-have-been-inferior-to-the-rest-of-their-careers-20190503-photogallery.html}{a photo gallery} of quarterbacks who, similar to new Dolphins quarterback Josh Rosen, had slow starts to their careers.  In one photo they highlighted the start of Peyton Manning's career:

\begin{quote}
  ``His first game was against the visiting Dolphins who grabbed three of his passes, including one for a pick-six by Terrell Buckley in a 24-15 Miami win. By the time the Colts had finished the first quarter of the season, Manning had piled up 11 pickoffs against only three touchdown passes. Things stabilized from there as he threw 23 touchdowns and 17 interceptions in the final 12 games. The rest is Hall of Fame history.''
\end{quote}

I hate clicking through these photo galleries and I usually don't bother with them.  But I knew I was going to have to read this one because I knew Manning would come up on a list of very good quarterbacks.  With all due respect to Tom Brady, Dan Marino and the many others you could mention, Manning is in my opinion the greatest quarterback in the history of the game.  I love all of those other guys but not one of them had to literally lift their team and carry them the way Manning did.

But that's not my point.  My point is that Manning elevated his game from his first \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Indianapolis_Colts_season}{3 win season} through to NFL history with the help of very good coaching from legendary offensive coordinator Jim Moore and quarterbacks coach Bruce Arians.  And Rosen is going to need that kind of help.

Like Manning, Rosen is smart.  In fact, \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/dave-hyde-blog/fl-sp-hyde5-jimmy-johnson-rosen-20190503-story.html}{in the words of former Dolphins head coach Jimmy Johnson}, probably too smart.

What did Johnson mean?

Rosen has a reputation for being arrogant.  Most Dolphins fans can't figure out where that reputation came from because \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-hyde-dolphins-rosen-20190429-story.html}{his introduction to the Miami media, as least, was nothing but positive}.  But I have an idea how Rosen might have gotten stuck with this label.

In my day job when I'm not bloviating about the NFL, I teach first year medical students.  Specifically, I deal with a lot of extremely intelligent, high achieving students that I greatly respect.  And those students challenge me by with a lot of questions.  In fact, even after doing this for going on 17 years, I'm constantly amazed at my students' ability to come up with things I've never heard before.

Sometimes these interactions test my limit when trying to show that I know what I'm talking about.  And, at least as important, they test my willingness to admit when I don't know what I'm talking about.  I enjoy these conversations, especially when the latter is true, because it forces me to learn something.  I'm nearly always better for having talked to a smart student about a topic.

But I have tell you honestly that not all of my colleagues feel the same.  There are some who believe that its their job to always show students that they are superior and they don't like interactions with students who, frankly, might be smarter, if less knowledgeable, than they are.  In the end, they explain their shortcomings to themselves by blaming the students.  Most feel that these students lack respect.

And that brings us back to Josh Rosen, who is by all accounts an extremely intelligent player.  And, let's be honest, his teachers haven't been the best.

After having had three offensive coordinators in college at UCLA, Rosen is going on his third offensive coordinator as he joins the Dolphins this season after only one year with the Cardinals.  Up until this point, \href{http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/288438/the-good-and-bad-of-josh-rosens-five-offensive-coordinators-in-four-years}{Rosen has had to deal with a carnival of coaches} including Mike McCoy, who was fired after week 7 last year, followed by Byron Leftwich, who was fired after the season.  

Someone with more cruelty in his blood than I have than me might have called it a "clown car".  

Nothing against the Cardinals staff but you don't go through coaches like that if you are good at what you are doing.

Bottom line, it would be no surprise to find that Rosen was smarter than his teachers.  And it would be no surprise to find that his teachers didn't react well to the situation.

So far it seems that Rosen has had the same benefits that Manning had in his first seasons with the Colts.  Let's hope that he finds a better home in South Florida with good instructors that he can respect and, just as important, who can respect him.

Omar Kelly at the Sun-Sentinel href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-sidebar-20190509-gpapecygtve4vnitzeveudpkne-story.html}{describes the defensive scheme} that the Dolphins plan to run:

\begin{quote}
``Miami’s coaches intend to run a hybrid scheme that incorporates both elements of a 4-3 and 3-4 front, and envision themselves playing with five defensive backs on the field at the same time, possibly as the team’s base defense.

``Charles Harris, the team’s 2017 first-round pick, doesn’t have a clear cut position. Is he a defensive end or a linebacker?

``Minkah Fitzpatrick, Miami’s 2018 first-round pick, doesn’t have a defined role. Will he be playing free safety, nickel cornerback, a cornerback on the boundary, or all of the above?''
\end{quote}

I think Kelly describes the forest well but he misses the point when it comes to the trees.  The players in this defense will be expected to do a lot of things but to say that they don't have ``a defined role'' really isn't true.  In fact, if the coaches do their jobs right, their role will be very clear cut and well-defined in any given situation.  That won't be - or at least it shouldn't be - the problem.

The problem comes in when you consider the talent of your players and whether they are capable of executing those well-defined roles.  In this case, new Dolphins defensive line coach Marion Hobby seems to understand the challenge.

  ``That’s where the awareness comes in,'' Hobby said.

  ``A coach used to always tell me if you trick the [defensive] ends and trick the free safety, you’re going to get a big play.  So those guys have to have some awareness to them. They have to play with their eyes and their feet. It’s hard. There are very few that can.''

  When you are playing a multiple 3-4, 4-3 scheme, to a certain extent you throw the old position definitions away.  But position definitions are still there.  They're just new.  The trick, just as it is in the old standard systems, is the same.  Getting guys who are capable of doing their jobs and getting them to the point where they can execute them is still the key to successful football.

Armando Salguero at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article230246299.html}{stumps for a Laremy Tunsil contract extension}:

\begin{quote}
``Look, Tunsil has not fully arrived. He’s not fully developed. There’s much room for growth. But no one in the Dolphins organization questions whether he should be part of the organization going forward. Because he’s very good.

``So, I’m told, there are plans to get Tunsil locked up long term also -- perhaps before the start of the regular season.''

``Paying now will ultimately be cheaper than paying later. Trust me, player salaries rarely go down. So signing Tunsil to an extension would be beneficial for 2020 and ‘21 cap purposes.''
\end{quote}

Salguero has a point.  But there are drawbacks.

As Salguero points out, the Dolphins don’t have to do this. Tunsil is under contract for 2019 and they have already picked up the fifth-year option for 2020.  If they had to, they could apply the franchise tag in 2021.

Interestingly, Omar Kelly at the Sun-Sentinel \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-xavien-howard-20190510-nmebckxrcnfnpfp2pamje77aeu-story.html}{asserts out in another article} that the Dolphins have been criticized for trying to do contract extensions too late.  He points to losses like defensive end Olivier Vernon, tight end Charles Clay, receiver Jarvis Landry, tailback Lamar Miller and offensive tackle Ja’Wuan James under Mike Tanenbaum.  I disagree with this assessment.  In each of these cases it wasn't a question of approching the player too late.  It was a quesiton of money and value where, right or wrong, the Dolphins in each case decided that there wasn't a match.

In fact, I would argue the opposite.  The Dolphins got themselves in some trouble after Adam Gase's first year by handing out a lot of contracts such as those for Andre Branch, Rashad Jones, and Kiko Alonzo that they'd probably like to get out from under.  In many cases, these players were extended when the Dolphins really didn't have to do it and they eventually let the team down either through disappointing play (debatably Alonzo), a lack of development (Branch) or poor football character (Jones).

Bottom line, a lot of money was spent that didn't have to be and probably wouldn't have been had the teams waited.

There are also some additional factors.  Players who get early long term deals tend to get comfortable.  This can lead to less concentration and a decline in quality of play.

And there is the fact that this sort of thing leads to the expectation on the part of other players that their contracts will be extended early, too.  So even if you aren't worried about extending Tunsil, the next guy who is more borderline will press for an early extension.  And when he doesn't get it, it can lead to an early hold out, one which agents have reason to expect might work simply because the team has a history of giving early extensions.

On balance, I'd say its better to wait until the 2020 offseason to extend Tunsil.  It would prevent Tunsil from having to enter a final, lame duck year and keep him out of the free agent market.  This while keeping the team from having to tag him and while setting a better pattern for other players under the new regime.  In the meantime, even if you are reasonably sure Tunsil is a part of your future, it gives you another year to make sure Tunsil remains healthy and to see how he develops and performs under the new coaching staff.

I think that would be what’s best for the team and best for the Miami Dolphins," Dolphins coach Brian Flores said.

Right.

This is, of course, what Flores has to say.  But this competition is - or had better be - slanted towards finding out what the young, potential franchise quarterback can do.  

It's absolutely true that you can't just trot Rosen out there no mattter what he does.  For one thing, evaluating Rosen isn't the coaching staff's only job.  Every young player on the team has to be examined and a determination has to be made about their future with the franchise.  That's particularly true of Kenyan Drake and Jakeem Grant, \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-xavien-howard-20190510-nmebckxrcnfnpfp2pamje77aeu-story.html}{both of whom are entering contract years}.

How can you evaluate your talent if the quarterback if the quarterback can't throw the ball accurately or run the offense?  How can you develop younger players?

So you do have to have a competant quarterback in order to develp and run the team properly in a rebuiding year.  But having said that if Fitzpatrick wins this job it will mean very bad things for Rosen.  And it will mean the decision about what to do come draft time in 2020 will have already been made.

Safid Deen at the Sun-Sentinel reports that the Dolphins \href{Safid Dee}{are giving running back Mark Walton an try out}.

I found this move to be ironic given that on the very same day Flores \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-xavien-howard-20190510-nmebckxrcnfnpfp2pamje77aeu-story.html}{characterized the extension of Xavien Howard's contract as a move meant to build team culture}.

Walton was cut by the Cincinnati Bengals last month after his third arrest.  He is facing felony charges for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon, marijuana possession and reckless driving. Significantly, the March 12 incident took place in Miami, his home town.  Now the Dolphins are not only giving him a second chance, they've brought him back to a city where old friends and bad influences could exacerbate the problem.

But that's not my point.  The problem is that they've brought him into a young locker room where veteran influence will have more than the usual impact on the development of the team.

I don't have a problem with Walton getting a second chance.  But giving it to him with the Dolphins seems like a very questionable move.

\begin{quote}
  ``I get it. Rome wasn’t built in a day. And neither were the Patriots. But this is simple roster management issue that could be fixed with a veteran addition, similar to how Jordan Mills’ signing potentially patches up the vacant right tackle spot.''
\end{quote}

Kelly is primarily concerned with the run defense but the problem will crop up when it comes to the pass rush as well.  The Dolphins are deficient at this position, the outside linebacker when they are in the base 3-4 and the defensive end in the nickel.  This position sets the edge against the run and pushes the passer.

There's no doubt about it.  The Dolphins have a huge roster hole at this spot.  But I'd love to know who Kelly thinks the team should sign as a ``simple roster addition''.  The truth is most teams are deficient in this area.  Anyone who is any good was taken off the market a long time ago.  Even if the DOlphins were willing to part with 2020 draft picks, most of those players aren't available via trade.

The Dolphins have evidently made the decision to let this position slide in a rebuilding year.  I don't like it, Kelly doesn't like it and you probably don't like it, either.  But I think its something everyone is going to have to live with because it's not a problem that will be solved until the next offseason now.

Adam Beasley at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins/article230302419.html}{thinks he understands} the Dolphins strategy in building the offensive line. 

\begin{quote}
``[Michael] Deiter checks all those boxes.

``Wisconsin’s do-everything offensive lineman started a ridiculous 54 straight games in college.

``And the Badgers are no finesse team.

``Wisconsin averaged 43.9 rushing attempts in 2018, compared to just 23.4 passing attempts.

``So while there were more talented options available to the Dolphins before taking Deiter in the third round two weeks back, there might not have been a better option.

``We’re going to be a tough, physical team,' [Dolphins head coach] Brian Flores said during rookie minicamp.

``The Dolphins drafted like it.''
\end{quote}

I think Beasley is right.  But I have a better explanation.

The Dolpins drafted Christian Wilkins, a defensive tackle, and Dieter, a guard, with thieir first two picks.  They are planning on being strong up the middle and building outward.  And that's a sound strategy.  Nothing disrupts the oppsing offense more than pressure up the middle.  Offensive guard is being recognized as an increasingly important position in the modern NFL as teams struggle to keep the pocket clean in front of the quarterback so that he can step up and throw.

There isn't much to say about it this early in the process but it is worth noting that installing a new defense and a new offense is going to be a particular challenge for this group of coaches.  The reason is simple - most of them haven't done it before.  Indeed, most of them have never even seen it done.

Many of the Dolphins coaches, both offensive and defensive, have spent their entire careers in New England, where head coach Bill Belichick is an institution and where the organization has been a smoothly running machine for a very long time.  Belichick probably doesn't even remember how he went about installing the Patriot defense from scratch, let alone his assistants.

The problem highlights one of the challenges that comes with being a Belichick disciple.  Many of these guys have never been anywhere else.

For instance, they've never developed the contacts in the league which can be necessary to succeed as coaches, particularly head coaches in Brian Flores's case.  So what happens when you have to hire assistants?  You look for former Patriots because you've never worked anywhere else and you don't really know anyone else.

Having veteran coaches like Jim Caldwell can help.  But that will only take you so far.  Flores and his staff have their work cut out for them in this respect.

Armando Salguero at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article230422099.html}{writes about the definition of leadership by Dolphins head coach Brian Flores}: 

\begin{quote}
``'If you work hard and put the team first, you’re a leader,' Flores said. 'I want to have 53 leaders on our team. I want 90 on our team right now. That’s something that you can develop. That’s something that you can talk about.'''

``Flores is right to point out that players on other teams might stay away and be leaders.''

``But everyone in that room Tuesday knew I was asking about the Dolphins. And [Rashad] Jones.

``Is he a leader on the Dolphins?''
\end{quote}

I'm glad that Salguero is pressing the issue of Rashad Jones absence from OTAs in a year where a new coaching staff is trying to install a new defensive scheme.  But that aside, I continue to be astounded that Jones is still a part of this team at all.

I understand that cutting Jones post-June 1 would entail \href{https://overthecap.com/salary-cap/miami-dolphins/}{eating \$17 million dollars in dead cap money}.  But the Dolphins have plenty of cap space.

How can you keep a guy who basically quit on your team by refusing to enter a game last year?  I don't care what issues Jones had with defensive coordinator Matt Burke or head coach Adam Gase.  As Flores, himself, correctly points out above, none of your 53 ``leaders'' should ever put pride ahead of the team, especially if you are a serving as veteran example.

I understand that football players aren't all going to be angels.  But right now the focus has to be first and foremost on developing young players and establishing a positive team culture.

Similar to \href{https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/running-back-mark-walton-gets-second-chance-with-miami-dolphins}{the signing troubled running back Mark Walton}, I can't imagine what \href{https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/points-of-view-from-a-dolphins-perspective}{a poor example} such ``veteran leadership'' will set for the youth on a rebuilding Dolphins team.

Every time Flores speaks to the team about ``putting the team first'', young eyes in that room will involuntarily turn to look at Jones (when he finally shows up).  I can't imagine the damage that will cause.

 Armando Salguero at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article230468024.html}{on the release of 2017 fifth round pick Isaac Asiata}:  

 \begin{quote}
 ``[T]he frustrating thing about this pick is that Asiata was drafted out of Utah with the 164th selection. And with the 190th selection the Los Angeles Chargers selected Sam Tevi, who was on the same offensive line as Asiata at Utah.

 ``And Tevi was a backup as a rookie. And last year he started 15 games and won the starting right tackle job for the Chargers ahead of Joe Barksdale, who opened the door for Tevi when he got injured and then was cut when he got healthy because Tevi won the job outright.

 ``Somebody in the Dolphins’ personnel department studied the same Utah offensive line and picked the wrong guy.''
 \end{quote}

 In fairness, the Dolphins were still 2 years away from losing Ja'Wuan James to free agency.  They had just taken Laremy Tunsil in the first round in 2016 and they were just moving him to tackle.  They needed a guard.

 Nevertheless, Salguero's point is excellent and well-taken.  Talent is talent and it isn't like the Dolphins couldn't have used a good developmental prospect that could serve as a back up in the meantime.

 The situation highlights a fundamental problem.  The general manager can set the general direction of the franchise and help make some final decisions on the players.  But Chris Grier, even if he's the right guy for the job, can't be everywhere.  It takes a village to put together a good draft and if the scouts can't recognize talent when they see it, it results in an organizational failure.  The general manager is just the face of it.

 This is an issue when you consider the fact that the Dolphins chose to stick with Grier rather than embrace big changes by hiring from the outside.  All the little indians underneath Grier stayed the same.  Here's hoping they improve their performance or it won't matter who the chief is.

David Furones at the South Florida Sun-Sentinal comments upon the situation of runningback Kenyan Drake:

\begin{quote}
  ``Under previous coach Adam Gase, Miami Dolphins running back Kenyan Drake’s workload would fluctuate from averaging 18 carries per game in the last five weeks of 2017 to having just 7.5 attempts per outing in 2018.''

  ``'He has a lot of skill and he’s working hard and he’s doing a lot of the things we’re asking him to do,' [Dolphins head coach Brian] Flores said. 'I think he’s obviously athletic, good hands, fast, elusive. He’s a good player. Working with him has been good.'''
\end{quote}

Even as Drake flashed potential last year, not many people around the team were advocating more playing time for him.  No one said it out right but the suspicion is that his work ethic wasn't up to snuff.  Apparently working with the veteran Frank Gore didn't bring it out of him.

It sounds like Drake is embracing his opportunity to work with the new staff and is looking at it as a fresh start.  Here's hoping it results in a more professional attitude and, as a results, benefits the Dolphins in a big way.

\begin{quote}
  ``There’s no doubt Miami must upgrade from last year’s starting duo of Davis and Ted Larsen, who is now with Chicago. Davis was the league’s 77th-rated guard last season according to ProFootballFocus, allowing seven sacks. Larsen, who started 14 games, was even worse, ranking 125th and allowing four sacks.''
\end{quote}

Amen.

This article highlights the past problem at guard and the fact that Davis is currently still the leading candidate to play right guard is an indication that the Dolphins have a long way to go at this position.  And the fact that third round draft pick Michael Deiter will likely beat out current starting left guard Chris Reed doesn't make me feel a lot better.  The fact is that this problem probably won’t be solved this year, at least on both both sides.

Many people have a habit of underestimating the importance of the guard position.  In fact, I used to be one of them.  But experience has taught me that this is the most important position on the offensive line.  Its easier to find guards like Deiter in the middle to late rounds of the draft.  But guard position, itself, is more important than tackle. Quarterbacks can step up in the pocket to escape defensive ends coming off the edge if the interior linemen do their job.  But no quarterback can throw with pressure in his face.

This is a huge problem that will likely stunt the performance of both Josh Rosen and Ryan Fitzpatrick along with the performance of the rest of the offensive players, will have to be judged with this in mind.

I think when we really get it right, and we get it down to about 125, 150, that’s when we’ll have really honed down exactly what a Colt is for our schemes.'''
\end{quote}

What the Colts are doing is a lesson for us all.  I have found that being brutal about cutting things out of my life, from tossing things from storage to pruning task lists, makes it a lot easier to get better results in the end.

Honestly, if you have something in your closet that you haven't touched for five years, are you really going to need it in the next 5?  Or the 5 after that?

Anyway, this is a sign that the Colts really know what they are doing.  The bet here is that going into the draft, any general manager worth his salt probably knows deep in his heart that there are only 50 or so players they are really likely they'll end up with.  Maybe even less.  So why put 350 on your board?

The ability to hone in on what's really important and trimming the rest seems to be one underrated key to success.

The bet here is that it's not coincidence that the Rams both appeared on Hard Knocks and went to London to play after permission to move to Line of scrimmage Angeles was given.

Oakland plays a home game against the Bears in London this year and it would surprise no one if they ended up being forced to volunteer to be on Hard Knocks as well.

The thought that the Jets would trade Bell is ridiculous.  The Jets have already paid Bell \$12 million and \href{https://overthecap.com/player/leveon-bell/2258/}{the cap hit if they traded him would be extremely high}.

Furthermore I have a hard time believing that anyone wouldn't want Le'Veon Bell, let alone an offensive coach like Gase.  I have little trouble believing that Gase thought they overpaid.  But the thought that Gase would trade him now that they've paid Bell is absurd.

New defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano is overhauling the defense despite taking over a very successful unit from last years defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who moved on to become the head coach in Denver.  The Dolphins are undergoing even more drastic changes under never head coach Brian Flores.

\begin{quote}
``Four different assistants — [outside linebackers coach Ted Monachino, [safeties coach Sean] coach Desai, [defensive line coach Jay] Rodgers and new linebackers coach Mark DeLeone — suggested that new voices should help combat complacency from players.

``'At the end of the day, if you walk into a meeting room thinking that you know everything, you may miss some points,' Rodgers said. 'And if something comes in that’s maybe a little bit different, you’ve got to pay attention a little bit more, so when your turn is up, you’re able to execute the way we expect you to execute.

``'There’s some things that from a language standpoint that may be a little bit different, but at the end of the day, the guys are focused in on what they need to do to be really good at what they do.'''

This is why analysts who are \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-brian-flores-20190524-vsfblusmmbdnjgxu7xmn53k2ka-story.html}{predicting things like ridiculous 0-16 seasons} for the Dolphins are wrong.  Its because it takes more than lack of talent to result in historically bad teams.

No first year head coach has ever gone 0-16.  Rod Marinelli was in his third with the Lions in 2008 and Hue Jackson was in his second with the Browns in 2017.

The Dolphins do have holes all over the field with important positions on the offensive line, at pass rusher and at cornerback filled with mediocre to less than mediocre players.  But all of those players are, or should be, laser focused as new playbooks are installed and as relationships with new coaches are built.  And every job is wide open as new coaches without preconceptions watch practices with a neutral eye that may decide that a long time starter shouldn't be given his position and that maybe a relative unknown should be given a shot. 

Dolphins coaches will naturally have an easier time getting the most out of their players this year.  And that could produce a pleasant surprise with a better than expected season.  But at worst, it won't produce anything historically bad.

``Luckily for [Josh] Rosen, he has had some recent experience in a similar scheme.

``Rosen revealed the new Dolphins offense has some basic similarities to the first of two offenses he ran last year as a rookie under former Arizona Cardinals coordinator Mike McCoy, who was fired after six games last season.

``McCoy worked under current Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels when they were with the Denver Broncos in 2009-10, while O’Shea learned McDaniels’ scheme in New England since 2012.

``Miami Dolphins quarterback Josh Rosen discusses the most difficult part of the offensive system.
'That tree kinda falls here,' Rosen said of the coaching circle before describing the essence of his new offense.

``It can take a lot of time to get to the point where you can simply concentrate on the opposing defense.''
\end{quote}

Exactly.

Rosen is very lucky here and so are the Dolphins.  Young quarterbacks can sometimes take a full season with a new before they get to the point where they can stop concentrating on their own offense and start concentrating on the game plan for the upcoming opponent.

What is more likely to hold Rosen back is how the other players on the field adjust to the new scheme rather than how he does.  Nevertheless, this is yet another reason why the Dolphins coaching staff should be able to get a good handle on Rosen over the course of just one season to make a judgment about whether he should be the franchise going forward.

There are rumors that the Dolphins are tying to trade Jones but they can't get what they want.  They have evidently decided that they best \
thing to do is wait the league out in the hopes that a desperate team on the cusp of winning will pay more if they lose a good safety in tr\
aining camp.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                            
If this is what they are doing, I do not agree with this decision.   Good strong safties are a dime a dozen this year and no one is going t\
o give you much for an injured one, even one that is among the best in the league at it.                                                    
                                                                                                                                            
More importantly, every day that a player who put his pride ahead of the team and refused to play remains on this young, impressionable ros\

Chris Perkins at The Athletic \href{https://theathletic.com/1013085/2019/06/05/rosen-and-fitzpatrick-have-vastly-differing-thoughts-on-dolphins-qb-battle/}{declares Ryan Fitzpatrick to be way ahead in the quarterback competition} and has him as "the clear favorite right now".  He says that "Right now, Fitzpatrick is the man."

I'm not entirely sure where this is coming from but many reporters around time seem convinced that this is a real competition.  Dave Hyde at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel is one of the few that seems to be taking it a step further to see the "competition" as a good thing for Rosen.  But at the same time, \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-hyde-dolphins-qbs--20190606-p47uiimvcrd23bwerijibktbfq-story.html}{he knows that its not exactly real}:

\begin{quote}
``The question the Dolphins will wrestle with until the opening game — and probably beyond — isn’t if Fitzpatrick gives them a better chance to win the next Sunday. It’s how Rosen would look by November with a couple of months of starts under him.

``It’s whether you go with the 37-year-old you know or the 22-year-old you don’t know. It’s a philosophical one, you see, more than strictly a football one.

``Bill Parcells always said the hardest decision for a coach wasn’t deciding if a proven veteran was better at that moment than a young player. It was looking two months down the line and deciding if that rookie would be better than the veteran by then if given the full chance to play.''
\end{quote}

Exactly.

What few people in the media seem to be acknowledging right now is that what the Dolphins aren't actually deciding if Fitpatrick is better.  Of course he's better.  Rosen is in only his second year and probably has not had the best of coaching up to this point.  What the Dolphins have to decide over the next few months is if Rosen is the future.  And that's more difficult because it involves projecting his development through this year and beyond.

One thing is certain.  The Dolphins don't have to show it externally but internally they have to totally commit to Rosen until they've made a decision on him.  He has to be nurtured and every opportunity to help him and evaluate him has to be taken.  And that means two things:

\begin{enumerate}
\item This isn't a competition.  Or more accurately, it isn't a
  competition between Rosen and Fitzgerald.  Because Fitzgerald's
  performance isn't relevant to the decision.  What Rosen has to do -
  and his comments indicate that on some level he understand this - is
  to prove to the Dolphins not that he's a franchise quarterback now
  but that he will be at some time into the future.
\item The Dolphins have to start Rosen until they've made up their
  mind that he's never going to be at least part of the answer to
  their quarterback problem, even if its just as a cheap, long-term
  back up.  If Rosen isn't starting week 1, it means they've already
  made up their mind.  And that will mean bad things for his future in
  the league.
\end{enumerate}

Already working to improve his production as a receiver, Gesicki also looks to shed the label of exclusively being a pass-catching tight end.

\begin{quote}
“I need to be able to contribute in all phases,” he said. “I need to be able to run block. I need to be able to pass block. I need to be able to run the routes, do everything. I can’t just go out and pass plays and sit out on run plays, so I got to be able to do it all.”
\end{quote}

I was almost disappointed to read this.  It means that Gesicki hasn't totally moved on from his year with former head coach Adam Gase.

I'm not one of those guys who constantly bashes a coach or executive once they leave town.  But in my opinion, Gase did Gesicki no favors by expecting him to block too much as a tight end.  Gase came from the Mike Martz school of offense where tight ends are there to block and if you want to set up a mismatch, you go with the big wide receiver.

The modern NFL works differently and Gesicki is a modern NFL tight end.  At 6'6'', 245 pounds he was drafted to catch passes, particularly as a red zone weapon, not block.  The Dolphins have Dwayne Allen to do that and he's pretty good at it when he's healthy.

The good news is that this doesn’t necessarily mean that Geseki will continue to be misused. When asked about Gesicki, current head coach Brian Flores didn't mention Gesicki's blocking.

\begin{quote}
  ``'I talked to him about this [Wednesday] morning,' Flores said. 'One drop is one too many; one penalty is one too many; one missed assignment is one too many. That’s kind of the standard, the approach we’re taking.'''
  ``'[Gesicki is] very talented. He’s working very, very hard. He’s catching the ball decently.'''
\end{quote}

I would say that's what he needs to hear.

\begin{quote}
Q: The point of the defense is to have multiple looks and be confusing, to throw people off. How hard is it to learn it if that’s the point of the whole scheme?

A: “It’s really not that hard. It’s more just you learn the concepts, you can just start pluggin in guys. If you just learn the concept of where the defense is at, it don’t matter who you put there. That part is easy. But at first it was a little hard, understanding it’s not learning one job, it’s about learning the concept as a whole. After a while, once you get that, the rest is pretty simple.”

Q: So it’s a different concept for the interior linemen, a different one for the outside linebackers, a different one if you’re a defensive back coming into the box?

A: “We all have our different adjustments, and little concepts as a whole. Linebackers can help the D-line if they line up this way. Linebackers can help the safeties if we just show inside or something like that. Really, you just have to learn the defense, what’s your role in it, and help other guys.”
\end{quote}

This is a facinating quote that gives some insight into how this defense will run.  It appears that, at least at the moment, the Dolphins are expecting players to have more than the usual degree of global persepctive in terms of how the defense runs and how their position fits into it.  This will allow them to take on slightly different roles depending upon the situation not by memorizing specific duties but by looking at it from a mechanistic perspective so that what they need to do simply makes sense.

It all sounds good in theory.  But let's remember that it really hasn't worked well to this point unless Bill Belichick was running the show in New England.  It will be interesting to see whether head coach Brian Flores has the right touch to bring it to Miami.

Omar Kelly at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel gives us \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-miami-dolphins-10-things-we-learned-offseason-20190607-nstletyi5vfj5gj7qo63gb4jjq-photogallery.html}{the ten things he learned about the Dolphins after offseason workouts}:

\begin{quote}
  ``Bobby McCain experiment at safety could stick

``McCain has all the tools needed to excel at free safety -- he's physical, rangy and intelligent. That’s why it makes sense to experiment using him as the last line of defense in Brian Flores’ hybrid defense. McCain has primarily played nickel cornerback the past four seasons. Having him work the back-end of the secondary could allow Miami to play Minkah Fitzpatrick closer to the line of scrimmage, which is where he excelled last year.''
\end{quote}

Count me among those who were surprised by this move.  Its not that I don't think McCain can be a good free safety - he can.  But along with pass rusher, cornerback is probably the weakest position on the team this year.  Xavien Howard is, of course, a given starter.  But other than him, there isn't much.

Now, in addition to the spot opposite Howard which the Dolphins are evidently counting on a relatively unproven Eric Rowe to fill, the Dolphins are creating another hole at nickel back.  At the same time they have an apparent glut at safety with Minkah Fitzpatrick, Reshad Jones, and T.J. McDonald and now McCain.

The problem that Flores is evidently trying to solve has to do with the fact that Jones and McDonald, both paid like starters, are really best suited for strong safety.  Kelly elaborates later in the article:

\begin{quote}
``Can Reshad Jones and T.J. McDonald work together?

``Jones and McDonald -- two safeties with similar in-the-box styles -- have struggled working together the past two seasons when they have worked together as starting safeties. McDonald doesn’t have the range to cover deep, and that role doesn’t fit Jones’ freelancing style because it requires him to be too disciplined. McDonald has lost 15 pounds this offseason, so maybe it will alter his game a bit. The coaches will have to get creative to use both strong safeties on the field together.``
\end{quote}

Hopefully the current coaching staff will do a better job of it than last year's staff did.  That's assuming Jones isn't traded, something I'd still bet will be the case.  In any case, the situation demonstrates once again how poorly the 2018 version of the team was built by former executive Mike Tannenbaum and current general manager Chris Grier.

In any case, the bet here is that Fitzpatrick fills the hole at corner back that the move has left in its wake.  Reports indicate that Fitzpatrick will move around quite a bit week to week as required this year.  But Nick Saban, Fitzpatrick's coach at Alabama, claimed that Fitzpatrick's best position was nickel back and playing him there will likely put him in a good position to do that as the extra defensive back on the field.

Adam Beasley at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins/article231200548.html}{got some interesting quotes from Mink Fitzpatrick} during mandatory mini-camp.

\begin{quote}
``So Dolphins coach Brian Flores wasn’t kidding when he told reporters a few weeks back, 'I’ll know what he’s doing. You guys probably won’t.'

``The important thing is that Fitzpatrick knows what he’s doing.

``And that wasn’t always the case in 2018 — at least on a day-to-day, and sometimes down-to-down, basis.''

``Fitzpatrick told the Miami Herald at the end of last season that he wanted to know by February which position he would play in 2019 so he could prepare properly.

``The answer he got back was, in essence, all of them.

``And that’s OK, Fitzpatrick explained in a way Wednesday that wasn’t altogether flattering of the previous coaching staff.

``'I wanted a position to focus on,” he said. “Last year, I couldn’t. I was playing multiple roles when I was at [Alabama], but I knew what I was going to be doing week to week. Last year, it was kind of all over the place. It was sporadic. It would change up halfway through the week. Some of it was because of injuries and some of it was because they didn’t know where to put me.'

``He continued: 'This year, I know where I’m going to be at. I know exactly what positions I need to learn, what concepts I need to learn. And I’m just more comfortable. I wasn’t saying that I just wanted to learn just strong safety or corner. I wanted there to be a game plan so I could prepare the right way. Last year I couldn’t prepare the right way, because I didn’t know what I was doing. You could say I could study the whole defense, but you can’t do that.'''
\end{quote}

In a way this is encouraging.  And in a way it isn't.

The odds are very good that, unlike the previous staff, the current staff will be able to decisively present Fitzpatrick with a game plan early in the week and in that respect he'll be able to better prepare.  They'll have learned how to do that and to communicate clearly to Fitzpatrick exactly what he needs to do from Bill Belichick when most of them were in New England.

But playing in the NFL isn't like playing at Alabama.  Opponents surprise you more often on game day with what they are doing on offense and rapid adjustments are necessary.  The odds are good that no one will have to adjust more than Fitzpatrick who will likely be at the center of the changes not only game to game but play to play.

Unlike in college, the odds are good that in his current role, Fitzpatrick is never actually going to be able to prepare the way he wants to because its going to be impossible to thoroughly prepare for everything over the course of the previous week.  Fitzpatrick is going to have to be flexible mentally in a way that he apparently wasn't last year.

If we take Fitzpatrick at his word, it sounds like he's might struggle with what the Dolphins are going to be asking him to do this year.

\begin{quote}
You wish Jim Caldwell all the best in his taking care of his health. You also understand this was a loss to this season’s plans. Caldwell was the only one with head-coaching experience on the Dolphins staff. As such, he’d be a sounding board for Brian Flores. Even more than that, he was a hands-on coach of the quarterbacks. And have you heard the Dolphins are looking for a quarterback? So the Dolphins don’t just lose the wise, old man who’s been up the mountain but a guide to the position that’s befuddled this franchise for a couple of decades.
\end{quote}

As Hyde points out, Caldwell wasn't just a guy with head coaching experience.  In my book that was a relatively minor role.  The big issue was that he was the quarterback coach.  Offensive coordinator Chad O'Shea coached wide receivers with the Patriots.  That leaves assistant quarterbacks coach Jerry Schuplinski, a guy who coached only veteran Tom Brady and who probably earned more from Brady than Brady ever learned from him.

The cards are once again stacking up against Josh Rosen ever developing as an NFL quarterback.  A guy who went through a terrible rookie years with two bad offensive coodinators under a defensive head coach last year, he's evidently going to have to go through one with another defensive head coach, an offensive coordinator who doesn't coach quarterbacks and a quarterback coach who has worked only with the most veteran of veteran quarterbacks.  Rosen's only prayer is that Schuplinski picked something up as they developed back ups like Jimmy Garoppolo and that 17 year veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick might have mercy and find some time to teach him something even as he does everything he can to keep him off the field.

I'm willing to wait and see but its hard to be optimistic.

Omar Kelly at the Sun-Sentinel goes through the story lines to watch as training camp approaches.  He correctly \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-camp-countdown2-20190716-pjsxv2okvncgnnoz5lqs4wyt3u-story.html}{identifies the situation at safety as a continuing issue}.

\begin{quote}
  ``[T]the key is finding a way to make [Reshad] Jones and [T.J] McDonald play well together, injecting their power and playmaking into a defense that will need plenty of each to be respectable again.''
\end{quote}

In some ways the Dolphins have a good problem on their hands.  Unlike the other defensive positions, they have three talented safties in McDonald, Jones and Minkah Fitzpatrick and they have an emerging free safety option in Bobby McCain.  But even good problems are problems.  Even if they play Fitzpatrick in what amounts to the nickel cornerback role, they can't get all of these guys on the field at the same time.  And we already know that isn't going to sit well with Jones, at least.

One option is to play McDonald in what amounts to a linebacker role.  This has been speculated upon since the Dolphins traded for McDonald and signed him to a long-term deal.  He's big enough to do it and his adding mobility on the outside of a 3-4 defense is an intriguing idea.

Another is to give up the ghost on Jones and trade him, something they really should have done before now.  As I've pointed out before, the Dolphins are sending a terrible message to their young players by keeping the prideful and selfish Jones on the team.

In any case, the Dolphins are still paying the price of the poor team building of the previous (and in some ways the current) regime.  Here's hoping they finally solve this issue in a way that maximizes their assets.

Greg Cote at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/greg-cote/article231207363.html}{thinks the Dolphins will be better than people think}.

\begin{quote}
``There are too many positive pieces to this team heading into training camp, starting with Flores at the wheel, to not believe the Dolphins will a lot better than expected this season.''
\end{quote}

See my entry above where I pointed out that the Dolphins at short on talent at cornerback and pass rusher.  These are the corner stone positions of every defense.

Sorry.  I'm not buying it.
