Dear all,

A few things:

1)  I have put together one more video on how optimal use of the CIRCSIM program.  You may want to give it a quick view:

2)  Because a) you have your first formative this weekend and b) I loaded you down with a large amount of physiology for Keith Simmons Sesson 1 (which is *not* covered on the formative), I have reserved rooms for Friday, 12/1, for you to come in and ask questons about the physiology material.  The rooms and times are:

11:00-12:00 AAC 969
1:00-2:00 AAC 1098

Please come and ask questions over any of the material to this point.

Don't forget that I have office hours in 1213 Jelke from 11:00-12:00 and 1:00-2:00 on Tuesdays and that I am in AAC 969 from 10:00-12:00 on Saturdays as well.

3)  I have posted the following announcement from Dr. Lynch regarding the Evidence Based Medicine portion of your course work:
