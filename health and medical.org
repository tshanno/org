Hi.
 
I’m still working on putting Scholar in the new template. I’ll be done soon.
 
I met with Nina yesterday and she doesn’t want student guide for the sessions. So both sessions are just faculty guides.
 
I have the faculty guides for Advocate. He and Scholar were my last two role areas to work on.
 
I’m not sure about that practitioner session. I would need to check.

Subject: Questions about upcoming sessions
 
Hi, Danesha.
 
So I’m looking ahead to see where we’re at:
 
10/28 Scholar - I see the self-study (thanks) but no faculty or student guide.  Is there nothing of that nature for this session?
10/29 Leader - I see the faculty guide and the self-study.  Shouldn’t there be a student guide?
10/29 Advocate - I see the self-study (again, thanks) but no faculty or student guide.  Is Paul behind getting these materials to you?  Do you need me to prompt him?
11/1 Practitioner:  Intro to the Stethoscope - I don’t see a section on Entrada for this.  Shouldn’t there be one?
 
Thanks,
Tom S.

  This took all of 10 minutes.  Height (5'7" even with shoes on sounds high), weight (175 pound sounds about right), blood pressure (120/80), and blood draw, presumably for cholesterol and whatever else.
  
  Results available online in a couple days.
