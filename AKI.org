*** The table in the matching actiity says that Na reabsorption decreases in dehydration.  This is, of course wrong.  It coud be we were thinking abotu pressure natriuresis in shich case the reabsorption in the proximal tubule would drop.  In any case, this should be changed.  It caused confusion.  I revised the faculty guide and re-uploaded it.  Make sure the change sitcks in 2019.
* *Self-Study Notes*
** Mike has a slide that says that M2 receptors cause relaxation.  They don't.  They reduce the relaxation cause by beta-2 receptors.  He's talking about moving this to Life Cycle (which he should).  Either way make sure this gets corrected.
