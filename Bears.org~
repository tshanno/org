Former Seahawks running back Mike Davis figures to be featured prominently in the offense, and the space created by the bookkeeping could prove to be for a few more smaller moves and then for the operating space the team will require for the season. Keep in mind that an extension for center Cody Whitehair could become a business item general manager Ryan Pace attacks during the summer.

Agreed that and safety

What gives? Do you think Gould is playing hardball with the 49ers? – Rory W., Dallas

San Francisco signed Jonathan Brown last week, a move that looks like a depth addition to me more than anything else. Brown was in training camp with the Bengals for the previous three summers but has never played in a regular-season game. The Niners didn’t sign him to replace Gould or even challenge him. I wouldn’t look into the move beyond that. The only hardball Gould can play with the Niners is decline to sign the franchise tag offer. My guess is Gould will use the tag to try to negotiate a multi-year contract with the club. San Francisco is motivated to keep Gould as its kicker.

It’s not impossible that they just want someone in case Gould gets hurt during the year. 
** DONE [#C] [[https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-mailbag-justin-houston-nfl-free-agency-20190312-story.html]] What is keeping Adam Shaheen from ascending to become a more productive tight end? Speed? Agility? Strength? Technique? Toughness? Durability? Football Intelligence? — @rto58

Durability is the No. 1 issue right now. Shaheen was injured late in his rookie season shortly after his playing time was increased due to injuries to others at the position. Then, he lost the first half of his second season when he was injured in preseason in August. He’s got to get more time on the practice field and more game reps to improve. He’s never going to be a speed guy and comparisons to Rob Gronkowski have been wildly off base since Day 1. That doesn’t mean Shaheen cannot be a productive player for the Bears and right now, he’s in line for a much greater role after Dion Sims was released. The Bears will be leaning on Shaheen to give them more as a run blocker unless they go out and sign another Y tight end or draft one. It’s my belief the Bears liked Nick Boyle but knew the market was going to get too big for him for them to be involved. He wound up re-signing with the Ravens for three years at $6 million per season.

To my eye the TEs and rbs in the draft look pretty good. 
** DONE [#C] [[https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/buster-skrine-bears-solid-drafting-finally-puts-free-agency-in-supporting-role/]] Regardless of what happens in free agency, the Bears’ chances of taking the next step in the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl are predicated on growth from within:

1. Mitch Trubisky and the offense parlaying a foundation year in 2018 into a quantum leap in 2019 — with or without running back Jordan Howard. The storylines of better communication, improved chemistry, reacting instead of thinking and Trubisky’s ability to read the defense instead of setting the offense will be over-written and tiresome by training camp. But nobody the Bears add on offense is going to change that scenario.

2. The defense avoiding a significant drop-off  — and potentially improving — in the transition from Vic Fangio to Chuck Pagano. Even without nickel back Bryce Callahan and safety Adrian Amos, the Bears still have 10 starters returning on defense. And that includes four 25-and-under players who should be better in 2019 no matter who is coaching them: linebacker Roquan Smith (22), safety Eddie Jackson (25), nose tackle Eddie Goldman (25) and defensive lineman Bilal Nichols (23 on Sept. 14).

Don’t underestimate health as a factor. 
** DONE [#C] [[https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/03/12/in-trading-big-time-receivers-giants-did-much-better-than-the-steelers/]] The Steelers got a third-round pick and a fifth-round pick for Antonio Brown. The Giants got a lot more than that for Odell Beckham Jr.
The reasons for the differences are obvious. First, the Steelers made it clear that they wanted to move on from Brown. The Giants, in contrast, insisted that they were keeping him. And the “we’ll keep him” posture often becomes the best leverage in trade talks.
Second, Antonio Brown embarked on a scorched earth/bleached ‘stache effort to get out of town. Beckham had engaged in no similar campaign to be traded.
It adds up to the Browns giving up a lot more to get Beckham (a one, a three, and Jabrill Peppers) than the Raiders gave up to get Brown, because the Giants were committed to perpetuating the ruse that under no circumstances would they trade him. The Giants played it the right way, and the Steelers simply didn’t

Point is well taken. But Pittsburgh devalued Brown with the way they handled his late season antics. They should have promised a trade before it ever got to Browns scortched earth policy. 
** DONE [#C]  https://theathletic.com/867055/2019/03/14/film-study-what-the-bears-are-getting-in-running-back-mike-davis/

This clip against the Cardinals shows him again following the set-up of his blocks while pressing the line of scrimmage. He gets defenders to commit to him, before sliding away to gain extra yards. This run also shows another standout trait — his contact balance, which has to do with his compact build and lower center of gravity at 5-foot-9 and 217 pounds.

He’s a lesser version of the 2017 Jordan Howard. He’s low to the ground and will be tough inside but he’s not fast. He’s not a weapon.

Cost-efficient. Pace has overpaid in free agency, whether it’s reaching (Pernell McPhee) or filling needs (Trey Burton). With a solid roster, he got more value than you normally get in free agency and filled key holes at nickel and safety while still leaving room for inevitable extensions to keep the core intact.

Hmmmm.  I’m not so sure. I think he still overpaid for guys like Davis. It’s just that they were smaller amount of money for minor additions.

As I understand it, Callahan’s camp made it known they were expecting a contract that averaged between $7-8 million per season. When the Bears learned that, they moved on, and that process led them to Skrine. Callahan would up getting a contract that averages $7 million per season from the Broncos, and the Bears landed Skrine on a contract that averages $5.5 million per year.

The Bears had to place a value on Callahan, and nobody knows him better than they do. They would have loved to have him back, but I don’t think they wanted to pay him more than what they paid for Skrine. Let’s see how Skrine performs with better talent around him in the secondary and a better pass rush than he played with for the Jets and Browns.

My question exactly.

I’m not sure what was wrong but it was affecting his vision as well. That probably decreased his value.

Personally not too happy about this trade. I have to assume whatever was wrong was physical and that after an off season of rest and whatever else he could come back and be the 2017 version of himself. Which was pretty good.

The trade probably has more to do with the fact that he didn’t fit the offense. In particular he wasn’t much at catching passes out of the back field. I liked him though and overall I have a feeling this was a mistake.

Will the Bears trade up to draft a running back? - Chicago Tribune]] Just wanted to get your thoughts on the Jordan Howard trade. Did Ryan Pace and Matt Nagy try to get a little too cute? I get he didn't fit what they wanted at that position. However, isn't it ironic that he can fit Doug Pederson's system in Philadelphia, which is basically what Nagy is running? Also, I realize they were not going to get a third- or fourth-round pick for Howard, however why didn't they at least try to hold on to him through training camp, when a team might be desperate for a running back because of injury. They possibly could get at least a fifth-round pick then. The fact they didn't get a pick for him in the 2019 draft just baffles me. It also reduces depth at the position, although it is likely they will draft one now. — Tom T., Parts Unknown

Some readers were not particularly happy with the trade, but only those who haven’t been paying attention were surprised. I’m not sure what you mean by get too cute with the transaction. The Bears took a look at the teams they thought could be in the market for a running back and found one in the Eagles. Based on the compensation they received — a sixth-round pick in 2020 that can improve to a fifth-rounder in 2020 if Howard performs well — there wasn’t much market for him. I have been writing since before last season that Howard’s trade value was going to be lower than most people figured, and it got worse after a disappointing season. Reality is the Bears were going to release Howard if they couldn’t find a taker for him. Some readers won’t believe that, but you don’t take a starting running back and put him behind a new addition in Mike Davis and potentially a new draft pick and pay him $2 million as the No. 3.

You make a good point — the Eagles run a very similar offense. Pederson leans on the running game a little bit more than Nagy, and the Eagles were looking for a back for the role LeGarrette Blount filled during their 2017 Super Bowl season. The bottom line is Howard was popular with Bears fans, but around the league he was never considered an elite running back.

The Bears traded Deiondre’ Hall to the Eagles for a seventh-rounder last year. Jordan Howard was a starter and Hall was basically a special teams player. That just looks odd on paper, so how was their trade “value” determined? — Petrie P., Parts Unknown

Well, the Eagles traded for Hall when he had two years remaining on his rookie contract and got Howard with only one year remaining on his deal. The escalator in Howard’s contract kicked in, too, so he’s going to make $2.025 million this season, more than Hall. It might look “odd,” but some folks I spoke to didn’t think the Bears would be able to find a taker for Howard based on his rough 2018 season and limited ball-catching ability. Combine that with the bump in salary and the fact he’s a one-year rental and it adds up to minimal trade value.

Will the Bears trade up to draft a running back? - Chicago Tribune]] With Aaron Lynch signed, will the Bears still target pass rushers in the draft? — @grant_seeds

I don’t think any team ever enters a draft and says, “We’re not going to look at pass rushers.” The old saying is there is no such thing as having too many pass rushers. That said, you’re not going find refined pass rushers or guys with traits that check most of the boxes by the middle rounds. If they see a pass rusher they really like, I wouldn’t rule it out. But I figure running back, cornerback and safety are positions they will have more interest in and I never rule out offensive linemen.

It’s a good draft for tight ends.

Will the Bears trade up to draft a running back? - Chicago Tribune]] We often saw Mitch Trubisky overthrow wide open receivers. What can you tell us about what he’s doing to improve his accuracy? — @dg122985

Accuracy is something football folks will tell you a quarterback either has or doesn’t have. Guys who aren’t accurate from the start usually don’t become super accurate. The good news is Trubisky set the Bears’ single-season record for completion percentage last year at 66.6. Yes, he missed some open guys downfield. Trubisky has worked with wide receivers this offseason, which could help when they get back to Halas Hall. It was a new offense for everyone last year, and with the players not having to go through that process again, you would expect things to be a little more crisp. That could make him more accurate.

Hell be more comfortable and that may make him more accurate. Remember he was known for accuracy in college.

None of it was a physical thing,” Nagy said of Trubisky’s errant throws. “It was all just him learning where to go with the ball. See, your clock goes so fast that everything you see … Boom! Ball’s out. You know? When you know what’s going on and things become slower, you can make that more accurate throw. None of it was physical. It was all just mentally learning the offense. And the other guys too. Sometimes the quarterback makes a throw and it looks like it’s a bad throw or a poor throw, but it was a terrible route.”

Couldn’t agree more. Highlight accuracy later in the season.

Indianapolis would be a good spot except for one thing. It’s far enough north to make weather a problem. 

When Radio City Music Hall left the draft four years ago, Chicago lobbied hard to be the new permanent home. But anyone who looked out the window at the heavy snow coming down in Saturday, the last day of the draft, had to agree that the the NFL made the right decision when they started rotating cities instead. 

Indianapolis isn't that far south of Chicago.

\textbf{Rich Campbell} at the \textit{Chicago Tribune} \href{https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-david-montgomery-position-coach-20190430-story.html}{interviews Iowa State coach \textbf{Nate Scheelhaase}} on the characteristics of new Bears running back \textbf{David Montgomery}:

\begin{quote}
``He’s a really good inside-zone runner. He has a good feel, especially in the shotgun, of just how the zone moves and how things feel, which is probably why Coach [\textbf{Matt}] \textbf{Nagy} and Coach [\textbf{Mark}] \textbf{Helfrich} and those guys were really interested.

``It was funny. There were a lot of teams interested in David, but the teams that seemed to be the most interested all came from that same tree. It was the Chiefs, Bears, Eagles, the Colts. Those coaches that came from that same tree, they have a bunch of gun runs that they run really well.''
\end{quote}

It's worth noting that the Bears were likely trading up to get ahead of the Bills, who were evidently looking for a running back and selected Florida Atlantic's \textbf{Devin Singletary} with the pick after Chicago's.  So there was likely something of a consensus amongst a lot of teams that he was the next best running back on the board.  Certainly the Bears suspected that the Bills would have taken him.

This article is worth reading.  There was a lot of good information beyond the usual hype.

  ``Does \textbf{Adam Shaheen} have a future with the Bears? Plagued by injuries first two seasons, I’m wondering if they’ll go in different direction, especially with capable free agents like the guy from Utah State. — @chuckietwoglove

``I can tell you that when \textbf{Matt Nagy} was asked about Shaheen at the NFL owners meeting, he was very positive. There is no question durability has been an issue with Shaheen, and if he can stay on the field, the Bears believe he can really help the offense. Let’s tap the brakes on the idea he will be replaced from the get-go by \textbf{Dax Raymond}, the undrafted rookie from Utah State. The Bears like Raymond and believe he has a chance to stick, otherwise they would not have guaranteed him $45,000 ($15,000 signing bonus with \$30,000 base-salary guarantee). But 32 teams passed on Raymond in the draft. The Bears still have an investment of a draft pick, money and maybe most importantly time in Shaheen. They’re not cutting the cord on him now.''
\end{quote}

One of the bigger surprises of the Bears draft has to be that they didn't draft a tight end from what looked like a deep class in the middle rounds.  The Bears have evidently decided to roll with Shaheen.  Raymond will evidently compete to back him up with an unsigned free agent.

Despite Nagy's comments, that second, inline tight end position has to be an area of mild concern.  Setting aside the fact that he can't stay healthy, Shaheen hasn't shown anything but potential, yet.

Yes, if you are a reporter.  Maybe not if you are a general manager.

I actually didn't think this was a bad question (no surprise given that it was mine).  Wisconsin guard Beau Benzschawel \href{https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1122584978724982784}{had offers from 20 teams} before signing with the Lions.

\textbf{Gregg Rosenthal} at \textit{NFL.com} \href{https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-around-the-league-podcast/id680904259}{comments upon the Bears} during their ``Around the NFL'' podcast (episode title: ``Around the NFC'', at the 24:45 mark).

Rosenthal mentions his distrust of teams that stand pat after a successful season and expect that roster to come back and perform at the same level (at the 24:45 mark).  Not that the Bears had much choice, as he acknowledges.

I share Rosenthal's mistrust.  This didn't work in 2007 with the Bears coming off of a Super Bowl appearance and it probably won't work this year, at least for the defense.  As was the case in 2006, the Bears were among the healthiest teams in the league last year, something that is unlikely to happen a second time in a row.  They also lost most of the defensive coaching staff.

But the reasons for this wariness go deeper than that.  Last year with a new head coach the players were less comfortable and likely for the most part concentrated harder on what was going on.  This year with the stink of success on them, at least a certain percentage of the players are likely to be more relaxed.  This can lead to a drop in performance.

In fairness, unlike 2007, the Bears have reason to believe that their offense will be better in a second year in head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy}'s system.  This is their best hope to maintain excellence in the coming season.

A: ``Ha, yeah, got to. James knows. I’m talking to James even more. He’s like, 'Why is Mitch talking to me all the time?' I was like, 'You’re my center now, bro, let’s do it.'''
\end{quote}

The Bears haven't announced it, yet, but this apparently let's the catch out of the bag.  I gather from this that \textbf{Cody Whitehair} is switching positions with Daniels with Whitehair moving to left guard.

It's a risky switch.  Daniels will undoubtedly be better at center but Whitehair was a Pro Bowl caliber center who was still getting better.  Whether the unit overall is be better with this switch will be one of the more interesting questions early in the season.

\textbf{Mark Potash} at the \textit{Chicago Sun-Times} \href{https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/first-and-10-bears-could-hit-the-jackpot-with-motivated-wr-emanuel-hall/}{quotes new Bears wide receiver \textbf{Emanuel Hall}} on his motivation after being passed over in the NFL draft.  Hall was expected to go as high as the second round:

\begin{quote}
  ``'I promise you it’s a feeling that I’ll never forget. That was one of the worst feelings ever, being undrafted,' Hall said at Bears rookie mini-camp Saturday. 'It felt like the longest three days of my life. I had a draft party on the second day and the third day you’re just shaking everybody’s hand, ‘Thanks for coming.’ — no one wants to do that.'''
  
``Hall’s speed (4.39 in the 40) and big-play ability made him an intriguing prospect in the draft. He averaged 23.5 yards per catch in his final two years at Missouri (70 receptions, 1,645 yards, 14 touchdowns in 22 games), with nine receptions of 50 yards or more.

``But a history of minor injuries that kept him out of four games last season and prevented him from playing in the Senior Bowl played a part in getting overlooked in the draft.''
\end{quote}

Hall fell out of the draft due to concerns about his football character.  Specifically, coaches at the University of Missouri were very up front about Hall's inability to play through those minor injuries that Potash mentions.  In fact, Hall missed the last day of rookie minicamp with an injury.  \textbf{Kenvin Fishbain} at \textit{The Athletic} elaborates:

\begin{quote}
  ``Hall battled hamstring issues and a groin injury last season, but instead of shutting it down, returned to finish off the season and play in the bowl game. Even though he got back on the field, the injury required maintenance in the winter, preventing him from playing in the Senior Bowl, and it almost kept him from performing at the combine.

  ``Doctors in Indianapolis told Hall not to participate in drills because of a possible sports hernia. Hall signed a waiver so he could run and jump, and while not at 100 percent, he ran a 4.39 40 and had the best broad jump recorded for a wide receiver at the combine (11 feet, nine inches).''

  ``Nagy discussed, though, how the Bears are confident in their staff to help with players who may have had durability issues in college.
  
``'There’s some elements to that in regards to our training program is going to be different than every other training program from other teams that they come from,' he said. 'We feel really good about \textbf{Andre Tucker} and what he does and our staff that he has, our strength staff, \textbf{Jenn (Gibson)} our sports dietician. And so we feel really good about when we bring people in here, we really sometimes don’t care as much about what happened in the past — what can we do now? Let’s fix it, let’s give him a clean slate and let’s roll.”
\end{quote}

Speed and ability aren't enough.  Apparently Hall is going to have to toughen up.  Otherwise he'll be just another track star that didn't make it.

\begin{quote}
Reading about all the early draftee signings, I remember a time when \textbf{Cliff Stein} was first to get the Bears draft class under contract. Lately it seems they’ve been bringing up the rear. What happened? — Greg M.

What’s the race? The NFL has slotted the bonus money and salaries for draft picks. There’s no advantage to completing this right away. I have no doubt the Bears will have all five draft picks under contract before training camp begins.
\end{quote}

I'm pretty sure the agent was mostly to blame for the Bears troubles signing first round pick \textbf{Roquon Smith} last year.  Nevertheless, one does wonder if the Bears could have settled the issues with him sooner had they been further along with negotiations when camp started.

Biggs asks ``What's the race?'' and that's fair.  But my question is, ``Why wait?''.  Get the rookies under contract so that they can workout without fear of injury.

In any case, with their first pick coming in the third round, I doubt the Bears will have a great deal of trouble signing their picks before camp this year.

\begin{quote}
Is \textbf{Brad Childress} under contract for the full season or just the preseason like last year? What role will he play with the offense? — @_d_r_r_

The Bears hired Childress as a senior offensive assistant, and he will be around for the entire season. He was hired as a consultant last year, working with Matt Nagy from the start of his tenure and through most of the preseason. He’ll be available as a sounding board for Nagy and will have input across the board on offense. Nagy is big on taking input from all of his coaches, and Childress will be part of that mix.
\end{quote}

If you look back at the history of this blog, you'll find that I had some rough things to say about Childress as a head coach for the Vikings.  But I like him in this role.  He's from Chicago and at this point in his career he probably wants to be here.  He's experienced in a way that Nagy isn't and there's very little doubt in my mind that he'll say what he thinks at times when maybe other assistants will hold back a little.  

But there's one other under looked factor here that could be of great benefit to Nagy and the Bears.  Childress has traditionally been a ``run first'' offensive coach.  He knows how to run the ball and that knowledge could be handy on a team where Nagy has constantly said that the running game has to get better.  Childress could help contribute to a big improvement in that area.

\begin{quote}
``Should the Bears pursue \textbf{Ndamukong Suh}? I think that would be a great addition. — @chiwest773

Teams can now sign free agents such as Suh without that transaction affecting the formula for compensatory draft picks, so we could begin to see some movement for some of the name players who remain on the street. Suh is in that category, as is offensive tackle \textbf{Jared Veldheer}, who is reported to be signing with the Patriots. I don’t believe the Bears are planning to spend big money on any players not on the roster. It’s possible offensive lineman \textbf{Cody Whitehair}, who’s eligible for a contract extension, is the only player who will get a significant payday between now and the end of the season.
\end{quote}

Suh would actually be a good fit for the Bears strictly in terms of what he can still do on the field.  At this point in his career he can still be a big, two gapping defensive lineman who will stop the run while giving a little bit of pass rush.  But he's nowhere near the player he was earlier in his career the last time Bears fans saw him on a regular basis with the Lions.  Suh is 32 years old and the Bears have trended towards younger free agents since general manager \textbf{Ryan Pace} joined the organization.  He's also not a great culture fit.

Whether Suh signs with the Bears or anyone else will come down to money.  My guess is that no one is going to make him a big money offer at this point.  As Biggs points out, the Bears almost certainly won't.  A lot will depend on whether Suh still wants to play the game for considerably less than he's used to making.

\begin{quote}
  ``Do you see the Bears signing any veteran pass rushers now that it won’t impact their comp picks? If yes, who? — @mellothunder

``This has been a consistent question throughout the offseason, even after the team re-signed veteran outside linebacker \textbf{Aaron Lynch}, and I’m a little puzzled why. The Bears tied for third in the league with 50 sacks last season. Only three of those 50 sacks were by players no longer on the team: Nickel cornerback \textbf{Bryce Callahan} had two and strong safety \textbf{Adrian Amos} had one. With \textbf{Khalil Mack} being paid as one of the top edge rushers in the game and with investments elsewhere when it comes to rushing the passer, I think the Bears are OK here. I can’t see them spending a lot of money for another player to add to the mix.''
\end{quote}

I think I understand why.  On some level fans probably recognize that the Bears depth is likely to be challenged more this year and they are worried about it with only Mack, \textbf{Leonard Floyd} and Lynch as reliable pass rushers.

Personally I'm not as worried about ti for two reasons.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Not many teams have good starting pass rushers, let alone depth at th position.  Good pass rushers don't grow on trees and anyone who is any good was signed to a roster a long time ago, compensatory formula or not.
\item I like \textbf{Kylie Fits} and \textbf{Isaiah Irving} a lot more than most people and think one or both could step up and do a decent job if called upon.
\end{enumerate}

It will be interesting to see how the depth at the position plays out this year.

 \begin{quote}
 Wiederer: Do you see any limitations in his game or areas he’s going to have to either really work on or work around to be reliable at the NFL level?

 Kiffin:  Pass protection. With the bigger players on that level, that’ll be more of a challenge. And being the backup here, it’s not like he got a million reps on film of that. So that’s going to be something he’ll have to work at if they’re going to want to use him on third down especially.
 \end{quote}

 No surprise there.  No team will put a running back out on the field who is going to get the quarterback killed.  Kiffin, a former head coach of the Oakland Raiders, would know that as well as anyone.  And most good college running backs haven't been asked to do it much. 

 The good news is that Kiffin thinks Whyte is a really good pass receiver.  But the bet here is that if Whyte sees the field much for the Bears his rookie year, it will be as a kick returner, a position that he excels at.

\begin{quote}
Rowe:  ``To bring you back to that last game (his junior year), we had a staff meeting and we were trying to talk about guys who could come over and help us because our numbers were down.

``The receivers coach and the head coach were like: Stephen Denmark needs to be over there. They were trying to sell us on: You should see the way he gets out of breaks. He’s 6-2 and can get out of breaks as well as all our small guys. So his feet are really good.

``Just naturally, him coming over to a new position, he’d have to get better at backpedaling and all that, which we didn’t do a lot of that. He was able to do it; it just took some time and work. He busted his (tail) and got it done.''

Campbell:  ``So did he play with a lot of vision, backed off a bit?''

Rowe:  ``No, we played majority press coverage. Turn and run with a guy. There were some situations where he did play a bail third, and he did a pretty good job with that stuff.''
\end{quote}

I'm really wondering why the offensive coaches pushed for Denmark to make this switch.  Big, athletic wide receivers presumably don't' grow on trees, especially at Valdosta State.  My conclusion is that it my have had to do with his hands and his ability to catch the ball.

The picture that Campbell and Rowe paint is of a very raw prospect who hasn't done much other than press coverage, a technique that requires athleticism with very little knowledge of the defense or of the awareness that is necessary to play other techniques.

Bottom line, Denmark only played a year at cornerback at a low level college.  Bears fans probably shouldn't expect an immediate contribution as he probably has a long way to go.  Making the roster would likely be an accomplishment for him.

At 6-4, 225 pounds Horsted was listed as a wide receiver at Princeton.  He will likely compete to back up \textbf{Trey Burton} at the U-tight end rather than at the in-line blocking Y-tight end position.

The latter is a weak spot in the Bears offense as \textbf{Adam Shaheen} tries to break out in his third year with the Bears.  Shaheen hasn't developed in part because his career to this point has been marred by injuries.

Right now Shaheen's primary competition comes in the form of veteran back up \textbf{Ben Braunecker} and undrafted free agents \textbf{Ian Bunting} and \textbf{Dax Raymond}.

One can only conclude that the Bears are a lot more comfortable about Shaheen being given this job than many of the fans are.

Florio also \href{https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/05/17/prosecution-appeals-suppression-order-in-kraft-case/}{explains why prosecutors are appealing a ruling in the case against Robert Kraft}, who is accused of solicitation in Florida.

\begin{quote}
``Multiple judges have ruled that the “sneak and peek” video surveillance violated the law by undertaking no effort to minimize the intrusion on the privacy of innocent persons who were simply getting massages. If the appellate courts don’t overturn these rulings, there will be little or no evidence against Kraft — unless prosecutors can persuade the alleged providers of prostitution to “flip” on their alleged customers.''
\end{quote}

I have no interest in this case except that it bothers me when someone tries to legally get off the hook based upon technicalities.  I know he did it.  You know he did it.  The lawyers know he did it.

Kraft is the owner of a franchise where players are constantly told to be accountable for their actions.  Is this accountability?  It might be the reality of the world we live it.  But I call it hypocrisy.

In any case, the situation \href{https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/05/16/if-robert-kraft-is-exonerated-what-happens-next/}{puts the league in a bind}.  They  haven't hesitated to suspend players who are obviously guilty but who have not been legally convicted, often because they paid off the victim.  Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Roethlisberger#Sexual_assault_allegations}{2010 suspension after sexual assault allegations} is a good example.

I think its fair to say that although the league has some morally upright fans who strongly disapprove, solicitation isn't really considered to be a big deal to most in modern American society.  It certainly doesn't rise to the level of sexual assault or similar offenses.  But in terms of obvious guilt or innocence beyond the legal ramifications, there are players who are going to be watching this situation closely to see if Kraft is held to the same standard.

``It’s easy to view [the approach] as obsessive, if not excessive. While it’s clearly important for a team to find a reliable kicker, the way the Bears are setting up this search also puts the job in more of a spotlight than it naturally brings. Now, as soon as the next poor soul to hold that job misses a kick and the Bears lose a game, he’ll become the focus of the larger failure. They made Parkey a pariah, partly for the miss and partly for his television appearance in the aftermath, and now they’re ensuring his replacement will be under even more pressure.''

You won't find many people that are too sympathetic in this situation.  If you have a kicker line up for a game winner in a Super Bowl, you would be hard pressed to find a situation more pressure packed.  You'd like to have a guy in that role that you are confident in.  I think most people will have a hard time criticizing the Bears for doing everythig they can to make sure that they have a guy who will react the right way.

That’s a good question, and we’ll have to see how things play out over the summer. 

We’re learning his skill set,” running backs coach Charles London said. “He’s a very versatile player and we’re going to put him in as many spots as we can and give him as much as he can handle, and he’s proven he can handle a lot.”

I think you will see him a little bit everywhere, and like I said, you want the ball in his hands because he’s that dynamic-type player, but obviously you can’t release him (into the pattern) every time. He needs to be back there. He needs to understand protections and what’s going on. He’s got to be back there to protect Mitch (Trubisky) when it’s time to protect him

Prior to this spring, general manager Ryan Pace had signed 10 outside free agents to contracts of three years or longer.

In relation to point 1, Trubisky won’t be getting the benefit of the doubt his year. He has to be successful or he’s going to hear criticism he didn’t hear last year. Refer to trib interview I just sent for comments on adversity. 

Regarding 4 the veteran QBs will be important. Nagy is the only experiences coach with a record of success and he was callin g plays so that Reid could spend more time with mahommes.

* Regarding 11 and 12.  How Burton does depnds a lot on the other TE.  Look for that Philedelphia article on TEs.   It was a great reference for this.  And it doesn't dcrease the Shaeen story line.

* Regarding 10, it all dends upon Cohen's ability to block.  If he can do it, he'll ba an effective 3rd down back.  Otherwise he's either a gadget player or another WR on a team that already has Gabriel and Miller.

* Keep and eye on Miller's hands.  Big play offenses can make up for drops.  WIll this one be able to?

Miller’s run-after-catch won’t be as apparent in a training camp setting, but his big hands and ability to win his one-on-one matchup should be apparent if he’s as advertised. Miller is going to be high on the list of “players to watch” because of his ceiling.

Training camp practices will also provide the first examples of how Miller and Gabriel are utilized in the offense — where they line up, which routes they run, etc.

Scott Bordow at the Arizona Republic \href{https://theathletic.com/945667/2019/04/25/2019-nfl-draft-live-tracker-dane-brugler/}}reviews the pick of quarterback Kyler Murray} for The Athletic:

\begin{quote}
  Cardinals general manager Steve Keim said he didn’t want to take Kyler Murray after trading up to get Josh Rosen in the first round last year but he was won over by Murray’s talent. This is a gamble for Arizona. Few teams had Murray as the No. 1 player in the draft and it’s fair to wonder if the Cardinals would even have considered Murray if they hired anyone other than Kliff Kingsbury as coach. This will either work out spectacularly for Arizona or cost Keim and Kingsbury their jobs some day.
\end{quote}

My guess is that Bordow is right.  The Cardinals don't take Murray if anyone other than Kingsbury is the head coach.  The reason is simple.  Murray fits what the Cardinals want to do out of the box whereas any other coach outside of Seattle would have had to change thier entire offense to make Murray work.  Murray's size makes him less than suitable for an offense that relies on sitting in the pocket and finding the open reciever.

I tried to figure out wher the next likely landing place for Murray was if he got by the Cardinals.  My guess is that it would have been a long way down the list.  Murray not only landed in the perfect spot to take advantage of his talents.  He may have landed in the only spot.
