    Hi! While I'm thinking about it, I thought I would give you early
    xmas asking from Ahren. There is a Star Wars series of books that
    he wants by Jude Watson called "Last of the Jedi", (Not "The Last
    of the Jedi", which is an entirely different series). Since this
    is a book request, I thought I would give you dibs. He will get
    the rest with his own money. He starts saving next week with his
    birthday money. He says his dad just reaches in his pocket and
    hands him whatever he has in his wallet. Last year it was like
    $37.63. Must be nice b/c if I did that, it might be $0.63. I dont
    carry cash, though in mine and his defense.
