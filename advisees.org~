Retreat Summary:
 
·         The video may be found here: https://youtu.be/e7Svaw4pby8.
 
·         We introduced our five new advisors: Octavio, Kenya, Max, Dayle & Joe.  Welcome!  We’re so excited to have you on the team.
 
·         Laurel discussed her new role as assistant dean for advising.
 
·         Christine provided a tutorial of our great new advising portal, Medleaders: https://admin.gradleaders.com/Rush/Admin/Login.aspx?sid=424
        Login with you Rush email account and the temporary password is:  Rush2019
 
·         Rahul & I introduced a new student self-assessment instrument that students will be asked to review with their advisors 2-4x/year.
 
·         You all provided great feedback particularly regarding the need for better access to resources, more clarity about expectations, and calendaring events for the coming year.  We’ve tried to at least begin addressing these below.
 
Resources:
 
·         Current resources for academically struggling students include Dijana Demirovic (Dijana_demirovic@rush.edu) in our office, and the University’s Center for Student Success (https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-experience/student-services/center-student-success).
 
·         For students struggling emotionally, there’s the University Counseling Center (2-3687), and a new Student Assistance Program will be offered in the fall.  Of course, if ever you are concerned for a student’s safety, don’t hesitate to get them to the ED. 
 
·         Additional advising resources may be found under the Resources tab on Medleaders and will soon include brief videos like Intro to the RMC Curriculum, a Medleaders tutorial, and Supporting the Struggling Student.
 
Expectations for advisors:
 
·         Individual meetings with students 2x/year.
 
·         Attending first Tuesday lunch meetings and planned social hours as schedules allow.
 
·         Coordinating coverage for events with fellow faculty and peer advisors.
 
·         Planning 1-2 additional outings or social events for advisees.
 
·         Attending at least 2 advisor development sessions per year.
