Apple’s Texas Hold’em game is so old it was originally developed for the iPod. While it eventually made the jump to iOS, it eventually folded in 2011. But now it’s back! With updated gameplay, graphics, and “new characters.”  You can even play against up to eight of your friends via Wi-Fi. (What, no Game Center support?)

Dear Thomas Shannon (Rush University),

Thank you for choosing our software and services.

Download your software from the Harris Download and License Center.

Below are your activation codes for your software.

Your activation codes provide the following software, quantity, and maintenance date or term/temporary license expiration date:

or Term/Temporary
License Expire Date
IDL 8.7 License	E026-13C2-02DB-30E8	2	07/31/2020
Please note, if you receive a new activation code for your current Maintenance ID, the new code must be used to update your older version licensing.

cp /path/to/some/file /path/to/some/file.bak
but once under the fingers it can be a very quick alternative
