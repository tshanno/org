Apple’s Texas Hold’em game is so old it was originally developed for the iPod. While it eventually made the jump to iOS, it eventually folded in 2011. But now it’s back! With updated gameplay, graphics, and “new characters.”  You can even play against up to eight of your friends via Wi-Fi. (What, no Game Center support?)

This went well.  I think that unless data analysis is involved that there's not reason whyI should have to drag a laptop on trups.  I should very seriously consider a new iPad, perhaps this fall.  We'll see what the mnoney situaiton looksl like.

Dear Thomas Shannon (Rush University),

Thank you for choosing our software and services.

Download your software from the Harris Download and License Center.

Below are your activation codes for your software.

E026-13C2-02DB-30E8

Your activation codes provide the following software, quantity, and maintenance date or term/temporary license expiration date:

Software	Activation Code	Quantity	Maintenance Date
or Term/Temporary
License Expire Date
IDL 8.7 License	E026-13C2-02DB-30E8	2	07/31/2020
Please note, if you receive a new activation code for your current Maintenance ID, the new code must be used to update your older version licensing. Your old activation code for the same Maintenance ID will no longer be useful. To re-host your license to a different installation, you must first use your new activation code on your existing installation before you can deactivate, so that that license can be used on a different computer.

You can access your licensing information at anytime through the Harris Download and License Center, just select Search Entitlements and search with your MAINTENANCE ID: 235841

If you need help or want to give us feedback, visit our Contact Us page.

Thanks,

The Harris Geospatial Solutions Team
