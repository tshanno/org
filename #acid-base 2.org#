For Denise to do:
*** Alter coverpages to add titles
**** GENERAL ACID/BASE BALANCE
**** BUFFERING RESPONSE TO AN ACID/BASE IMBALANCE
**** COMPENSATORY RESPONSES TO AN ACID-BASE IMBALANCE
**** FOR REVIEW ONLY: Fluid and Electrolyte Balance
*** Please add the following explanation to the fluids and electrolytes coverpage:

The following is for REVIEW ONLY.  The material in this lesson is made up entirely of material that you were exposed to in the Host Defense
Host Response Block. As a result, this material is considered to be review and you are not obligated to
read/view the content if you feel comfortable with your knowledge of it already.

Note that though I will not be flipping through this lesson and asking questions DIRECTLY about the
content, I will assume that you know it and can apply it in relation to new material. If, therefore, you feel
weak on the subject or you do not feel confident that you remember it well, I strongly suggest that you
at least quickly review the content either by scanning the document or watching the videos at double time
(or both at the same time). Also note that this is background which will be important for the fluids and
electrolytes pathophysiology which you ARE responsible for.
