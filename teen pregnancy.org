** DONE [#A] Alter concept map for teen pregnancy prostaglandin wrong and direct connection from oxytocin is wrong  <2019-02-28 Thu>
*** I disconnected oxytocin from increased oxytocin receptors and replaced it with a direct connection to increased coordinated contractions.
*** I'm not sure what was wrong with the prostaglandin.  The notes say it directly increased uterine contractions.  I should have taken better notes.  I guess I'll find out if there was something really wrong this year.
