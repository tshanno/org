  Talked to Jeffrey.  He's taking care of this stuff.  Follow up at the end of the week and see where we stand.
:END:
*** Women's Health is a problem.  Many of these topics are actually things like Advocate and Practitioner.
*** The physiology is correct as uploaded.  These topics need to be moved.
*** We need to ask Kristen about hers.
*** Pathophys:  I don't think Genital ulcers is the same as Syphillis.  I belive Syphyillis is a collaboration with Micro.
