The case is in “read only” for me, so here are a few suggestions to consider (otherwise I would have done these things myself and not bothered you).
 
Make the whole guide one font
Do spell check – there were a few punctuation errors
Add page numbers
At the bottom of page 5, add this to the instructions to the students: “Develop a diagnostic plan to test your DDX.”
Page 6: Remove “Case continued”
For the charts on page 8, clarify that these are to be reviewed by the faculty as part of the explanation of the answer.
Bottom of Page 14: I would make the reference black. In other words, provide it in the student guide.
Page 15: Clarify, in the title of the activity, that Mark’s activity is on male infertility
Clarify, for the coordinator who finalizes the guide, that some of the images are for the faculty guide only.
The answer for activity C’s section on “Peritubular fibrosis” needs to be in blue (it appears in black)
Page 25: Faculty instructions for the Quiz should all be in blue.
 
Feel free to let me know if you have any questions about this.

I was just looking over the material and then received 2 emails from students.  The last question on the self-study is on microdeletions which we moved to another case.  Is there a way to put out a message to the students to ignore the last genetic self-study question?

** Be sure to contact Neeral and add these topics to infertility [[message://%3c49242D53-C6D7-4DF4-8CCD-E4E183AB4493@rush.edu%3E][Re: Sexuality/Reproduction for AY 20/21]]
SCHEDULED: <2020-02-15 Sat>

Hi Tom, Rahul, and Bob-

There are a # of psychiatric disorders related to sexuality that I don't believe we are covering in the curriculum yet (they are the sexual paraphilias, hypoactive sexual desire, sexual aversion, anorgasmia, psychological causes of erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, and sexual pain disorders).  I wonder if there might be an opportunity to add a brief psych-focused "Sexual Dysfunctions" lecture somewhere in next year's Sexuality/Reproduction block.  I think it is too late to add anything like that this year but I just wanted to put it on the radar.  Thanks-

Neeral

*** The reviewer regarding this paragraph and the figure that goes with it.

"When the normal 14 and normal 21 migrate to one pole, leaving the 14:21 in the other pole, the
offspring would either have normal chromosomes or a balanced rearrangement, like the parent. If,
however the 14;21 migrates with the 21, when this is fertilized with a normal amount of chromosomes,
this results in 3 copies of chromosome 21 in one cell and loss of chromosomes 21 (monosomy 21) in
another cell. Monosomy 21 is not compatible with life. If the 14;21 migrates with the 14, a conceptus
would have either trisomy 14 or monosomy 14. Both are incompatible with life. Monosomy 21, Trisomy
14 and Monosomy 14 are incompatible with life. When an individual is a carrier of a Robertsonian
translocation there is a 15% risk that their child will have an unbalanced rearrangement. This is because
the only unbalanced combination compatible is the additional copy of 21. Not all conceptions with +21
make it to full term. There is a significant risk of pregnancy loss."

Comment:
This paragraph/diagram is pretty confusing to me. It might be helpful to include arrows from the labels to the diagrams of the offspring gametes in the bottom row. The alignment is off and it makes it confusing
*** And this was confusing.

"In most cases a male has one X and one Y chromosome (46,XY). Females have usually had 2 X
chromosomes (46,XX). Ambiguous genitalia are defined as difficulty in determining if the child is an over
vitalized female or underivatized male. In some cases, there is a problem in the chromosomes, usually
the sex chromosomes. There are also single gene disorders which can result from virilization of female
genitalia. There are also single gene problems resulting in abnormal male external genitalia. During
embryonic development excess testosterone can result in virilization of female genitalia. Loss of
receptors at the cell membranes for testosterone can result in female external genitalia in an individual
with XY karyotype."

Comment:
Or should the sentence be over virilized female and undervirilized male? Either way, it is confusing as is

*** DONE [#A] For Fetal Death, give columns 2 and 3 and match #1

*** DONE [#A] For Fetal Death, Add note to CEs that USMLE questions are optional
***  Some general edits:

**** DONE [#A] Tom:  I still need to check the dates in the headers of all of these guides.

**** DONE [#A] We need to update the contact information for Microbiology.  Presumably this will be Nell and Paria but Paria hasn’t been officially hired.  I’ll put Nell’s info in.

**** DONE [#A] This is done.  Post AGB
Keith - Abnormal Uterine bleeding is very close.   Mark Pool still needs to find out how to create links to the virtual slides and embed them into the guide so that the students can get a good, high resolution look at them.  I believe he also still needs to embed images that are not marked up for the student guide.  Mark, can you please get this done ASAP?
**** DONE [#A] Carl - Pelvic inflammatory disease is almost done as well.  Gary still has a minor edit for the women’s health activity where he’s going to make sure the students know what they need to take away from the tables in the answers.  Gary, can you please do this ASAP?
**** DONE [#A] Keith - Infertility:  

Anne is working a little bit on the clinical reasoning.  Gary, can you please see the note from Anne under the “testing” section of the clinical reasoning and work with her on finishing this up?

We made a slight alteration to Jerry’s new path activity.  Students will now be given some of the differentials which we felt were diseases that the students haven’t had yet.  I’ve also added a note to the CEs to ask them to simply walk the students through part I of this exercise.  Jerry, are the last two images in part II supposed to be marked up in the student guide as well?  If not, we need non-marked up versions.

**** DONE Keith - Teen pregnancy:  Anne is altering the clinical reasoning.  Students will be asked to interpret the urinalysis and give next steps.

**** DONE Paola - Fetal Death is in remarkably good shape.  We didn’t think any of the exercises needed to be altered.  Anne is altering the clinical reasoning and for now the plan is to duplicate what we are planning for Teen Pregnancy.  Identify a test, ask for interpretation and identify next steps.  We didn’t settle on a test, however, and suggestions about what to do about this section are welcome.
