The case is in “read only” for me, so here are a few suggestions to consider (otherwise I would have done these things myself and not bothered you).
 
Make the whole guide one font
Do spell check – there were a few punctuation errors
Add page numbers
At the bottom of page 5, add this to the instructions to the students: “Develop a diagnostic plan to test your DDX.”
Page 6: Remove “Case continued”
For the charts on page 8, clarify that these are to be reviewed by the faculty as part of the explanation of the answer.
Bottom of Page 14: I would make the reference black. In other words, provide it in the student guide.
Page 15: Clarify, in the title of the activity, that Mark’s activity is on male infertility
Clarify, for the coordinator who finalizes the guide, that some of the images are for the faculty guide only.
The answer for activity C’s section on “Peritubular fibrosis” needs to be in blue (it appears in black)
Page 25: Faculty instructions for the Quiz should all be in blue.
 
Feel free to let me know if you have any questions about this.

  Jeffery said he would email her.  Apparently she owes reviews for HDHR as well.  I told Janice not to wait.  I need it up on time with or without the review.

  Melissa Rice has this one.  Jeffery just emailed her Tuesday (I was copied).  If it not in at the end of the weekend, bug her yourself.

** Be sure to contact Neeral and add these topics to infertility [[message://%3c49242D53-C6D7-4DF4-8CCD-E4E183AB4493@rush.edu%3E][Re: Sexuality/Reproduction for AY 20/21]]
SCHEDULED: <2020-02-15 Sat>

Hi Tom, Rahul, and Bob-

There are a # of psychiatric disorders related to sexuality that I don't believe we are covering in the curriculum yet (they are the sexual paraphilias, hypoactive sexual desire, sexual aversion, anorgasmia, psychological causes of erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, and sexual pain disorders).  I wonder if there might be an opportunity to add a brief psych-focused "Sexual Dysfunctions" lecture somewhere in next year's Sexuality/Reproduction block.  I think it is too late to add anything like that this year but I just wanted to put it on the radar.  Thanks-

Neeral

*** DONE [#A] For Fetal Death, give columns 2 and 3 and match #1

*** DONE [#A] For Fetal Death, Add note to CEs that USMLE questions are optional
***  Some general edits:

**** DONE [#A] Tom:  I still need to check the dates in the headers of all of these guides.

**** DONE [#A] We need to update the contact information for Microbiology.  Presumably this will be Nell and Paria but Paria hasn’t been officially hired.  I’ll put Nell’s info in.

**** DONE [#A] This is done.  Post AGB
Keith - Abnormal Uterine bleeding is very close.   Mark Pool still needs to find out how to create links to the virtual slides and embed them into the guide so that the students can get a good, high resolution look at them.  I believe he also still needs to embed images that are not marked up for the student guide.  Mark, can you please get this done ASAP?
**** DONE [#A] Carl - Pelvic inflammatory disease is almost done as well.  Gary still has a minor edit for the women’s health activity where he’s going to make sure the students know what they need to take away from the tables in the answers.  Gary, can you please do this ASAP?
**** DONE [#A] Keith - Infertility:  

Anne is working a little bit on the clinical reasoning.  Gary, can you please see the note from Anne under the “testing” section of the clinical reasoning and work with her on finishing this up?

We made a slight alteration to Jerry’s new path activity.  Students will now be given some of the differentials which we felt were diseases that the students haven’t had yet.  I’ve also added a note to the CEs to ask them to simply walk the students through part I of this exercise.  Jerry, are the last two images in part II supposed to be marked up in the student guide as well?  If not, we need non-marked up versions.

**** DONE Keith - Teen pregnancy:  Anne is altering the clinical reasoning.  Students will be asked to interpret the urinalysis and give next steps.

**** WAITING Paola - Fetal Death is in remarkably good shape.  We didn’t think any of the exercises needed to be altered.  Anne is altering the clinical reasoning and for now the plan is to duplicate what we are planning for Teen Pregnancy.  Identify a test, ask for interpretation and identify next steps.  We didn’t settle on a test, however, and suggestions about what to do about this section are welcome.
