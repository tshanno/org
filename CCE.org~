******* Can we clear Thursdays after the formative 9/19
******* Are we actually going to give them 2 weeks to study for the S&R final exam.
******* Tetralogy of Fallot on 10/17 is a double case.  It would be extremely helpful if you coul dmove the final off of Monday into the previous week.
******* I think we can justify putting the EKG workshop on 11/15 but Friday (11/16) would be better after the formative
******* Pre-renal dehydration is a double case.  Putting it the Monday after the midterm on Friday is a disaster waiting to happen.  This session was universally reviled last year as it landed the day after a formative.  I don't know what to do with this session but putting it there is a problem.  Maybe you coud move this sesson to Tuesday and put the midterm on Thursday the week before.

Hi, Maria,

So I tagged two assessments.  The second Formative in S&R, 2018-2019 and the third formative from the GU Block in the legacy curriculum (2016-2017).  A few things:

1.  There was no 2017-2018 assessment.  The GU block was in the first year of the legacy curriculum and the reproduction is taught in the second year of the current curriculum.  So there was a one year gap where the reproductive material wasn’t taught.  I doubt this is a huge issue but you’ll want to account for it if necessary.
2.  It was unclear to me whether the 2016-2017 assessment should be tagged.  The reason is because the formatives that year were non-secure.  For the purposes of the exercise I tagged it but this may be something that you might want to specify.
3.  As I suspected, having Rahul’s wiki open was handy.  This allowed me to quickly identify topic numbers before actually trying to tag the time.  Doing a search for the topic number quickly brought it up.
4.  The total time this took me was probably less than 30 minutes.  Once I’ve done a few it probably will be quicker.  But doing a summative would take a lot longer because the legacy items aren’t tagged and you have to go through every question to see if it was yours.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Tom S.

*** From Princess [[message://%3c634E8415-CC40-4818-AEC2-7DFA0DAFF238@rush.edu%3E][Re: Update: Course Review Ad Hoc committee]]:

Regarding Clerkship/Elective Review:  We have a planning meeting scheduled for this Wednesday in which I was going to update you on the things that occurred while you were away. Michelle is referencing the Clerkship Reviews they are going to continue to use the Google sheets to collect their data for the remainder of the Academic year because the questions have changed as they initial presentation roll out. Therefore we would constantly have to redo the survey for that pathway.  
 
Regarding Pre-Clerkship Review:  The Course Reviews for Pre-clerskship are currently using the Word/Google Doc template.  The reviews are almost complete for the year.  In the interim, Anne and I will still buildout the Pre-clerkship and Clerkship/Electives phases in SurveyMonkey. 
 
Regarding Another Meeting:
Right now, I don’t think we don’t need another meeting since we developing the survey, unless you both think otherwise. We learned toward the end of last week that we have to rebuild the survey from scratch to do the Progress navigation sidebar since our current subscription does not include that feature (our workaround it rebuilding it)
 
Regarding Student Comments Checklist for LCME:
Tom, I did speak to Jamie about scheduling the meeting regarding a checklist for the needed LCME requirements. She suggested that she take a crack at the checklist since it is based on LCME for your review.

*** [[message://%3cBD0DE167-E2F9-4E11-AC53-7EE669C50947@rush.edu%3E][Grade Rounding/Significant Figures Proposal for I&I]]
Hi Tom,

I’d like to propose to I&I that this language be added as an addendum to all RMC syllabi, effective this yea:
 
All calculations involving grades will be rounded to the nearest tenth (##.#). If in the digit in the hundredths position (to the right of tenths position) is 5 or greater, the tenths position will be rounded up to the next highest digit. If in the digit in the hundredths position (to the right of tenths position) is 4 or lower, the tenths position will not change. This will apply to all student scores, minimum passing levels, and standard deviations. Minimum pass levels must be met to the tenth position (e.g., 70.0). As an example, a student score of 69.94 is reported as 69.9 and does not mean the minimum pass level (70.0).

Thanks,
Mark
*** DONE [#A] Email Mark and ask him to specify the dates for propoosal

*** Edge case for not rounding to nearest decimal that came out of discussion of rounding policy with Mark.
Consider the folloiwng case:
Pass cut is 69.51 (1.5 SD below mean)
Student gets 65.49

By the policy as written, pass cut and student score are both rounded to 69.5 and student passes.

If we round to nearest % then pass score rounds to 70% and student rounds to 69.  Student doesn't pass.

Mark assures me that edge cases like this do happen.

SCHEDULED: <2019-05-20 Mon>

*** New standards policy which assigns incomplete to students until make up went through pretty easily.  Unanmiously approved.
*** Hem/Onc was reviewed and approved.
*** I talked to Maureen afterwards and the review for Complex cases was accurate.  Tes twill be in testing  center and all five BSci cases sessions will be required but she will ask for an extra excused absence next year (total of two).
*** DONE [#A] Contact Princess and tell her Maureen's review is fine.

*** Went through the student comments with Deri.  The reviews were disappointing and he will make changes for next year.  These will be:
**** Re-write notes using complete sentences.
***** DONE [#A] Send Deri one of the VF cardiovascular lessons to look at.  
Maybe both the Heart Lesson (Levis style) and the Structure and function notes which were converted from the Joel Michale style.
**** Make sure all of the figures used in the videos aare in the notes.
***** TODO I need to makes sure that the heart failure case figues from the videos get added to my own heart notes

**** Re-write summative questions and maybe formative questions to make them consistent with each other and of the same difficulty.
**** Re-record videos standing in front of the camera
***** Record video with Deri <2019-05-15 Wed 13:30-14:30>
*** Deri's personal problems with his wife and kids being in Kansas City aren't helping here.  The impression I got is that he is definitley planning to join them eventually.  He feels like he needs to leave Rush in order to jump start his research career.  I can't help him iwht that but I can with the teaching.  I don't think I have to plan on him leaving any time soon.

***** Started the process of reviewing the new course review website.  I will probably encourage members to submit their comments via email so that we can have a quick vote at the next WG meeting.  Talk to Adam about this.

***** There were a couple action items associated with the evaluation of the USMLE Step data for the rising M4 class (i.e. not the students who have just taken the exam.  Adam will expand.

***** I asked Bob about this.  I guess it effectively amounts to an elective that is "free time" for independent study. 

****** I get the impression that most students are either taking this at the begninng of the year for extra Step 1 study time or at the end of the fourth year as an elective to effectively finish early.

****** Why is there an enrollemnt limit.  That is, why is it a problem is "too many" students take it at once?  Isn't that what's happening at the end of the M4 year?

****** Ask Aimee about this.
