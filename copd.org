** Make sure Sarah's content for COPD gets posted to the proper folder.  It didn't exist as of [2019-08-13] [[message://%3c289F6D9E-1055-45A0-B3A1-1C6413A60A2B@rush.edu%3E][Re: Vital Fluids Material]]
SCHEDULED: <2019-10-11 Fri>


I uploaded Sarah’s AKI and CKD content and copied over the CHF file.  However, I was unable to upload the COPD document.  The link in the nutrition content outline doesn’t work and there’s no nutrition folder under COPD.

Clinical tie ins that could be added for next year.
 
COPD ventilator time/volume wave forms demonstrating breath stacking leading to increasing pressures, increased intrathoracic pressure->decreased venous return->hypotension. Fixed by slowing down the rate to allow full expiration, shortening the inspiratory time to allow more expiratory time. This happens even in people not on a ventilator, they get very anxious from dyspnea and start breathing faster and not exhaling completely, slowing down their rate can be helpful.
 
Bipap is helpful because it splints open the airways preventing collapse, pursed lip breathing does something similar. We could ask why do we teach COPD patients pursed lip breathing? If COPD patients have trouble breathing out, why would we put a bipap mask on them and increase the pressure that they are breathing against?
 
This stuff is definitely beyond M1 level but I think it explains why the physiology is clinically relevant.
