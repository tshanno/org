** Hepatorenal syndrome review
	[[message://%3c02052B0B-5685-46C8-86B7-BAA851C2FE6B@rush.edu%3E][Hepatorenal syndrome]]
** Liver and Gall bladder
*** Componentsof bile•bilesalts (conjugates of bileacids) •bilepigments (e.g. bilirubin) •cholesterol•phospholipids (lecithins) •proteins •electrolytes (similar to plasma, isotonicwith plasma) 
*** Dehydroxylation of bileacids by bacteriain digestivetract=secondary bileacids
*** bilesalts (conjugates of bileacids with taurineor glycine)
*** Bileacids/ salts emulsify lipids and formmixed micelles necessary for lipid digestion and absorption
*** up to 95% of bileacids arerecirculated 
*** Uptake is terminalileum, Na-coupled cotransporter;active transport process (conjugates) and passive absorption (unconjugated)
*** bacteriain terminalileumand colon deconjugatebile salts allowing passiveabsorption by diffusion
*** [[/Users/tshanno/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Preview/Documents/Screen Shot 2019-03-03 at 12.36.14 PM.png][Bile acid absorption]]
*** Control of biliary secretion 
**** Feedback control of bilesalt synthesis and secretion by bile saltconcentration in hepaticportalblood 
**** Hormonalcontrol:*cholecystokinin*, gastrin 
**** Neuralcontrol:-parasympatheticstimulation increases biliary secretion -sympatheticstimulation decreases biliary secretion
** Gall bladder
*** cholesterol and bilirubin are the compnents of bile that cause gall stones
**** cholesterol gallstones (most common)
**** bile pigment gallstones (unconjugated bilirubin)
**** mixed stones
*** [[/Users/tshanno/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Preview/Documents/cholestrerol gall stone formation.png][Supersaturation of bile with cholesterol at different lecithin/bile salt concentration]]
*** Bile is more concentrated (up to 20-fold) in gallbladder --> stones are more likely to form in the gallbladder than  outside
** Gastric secretion
*** parietal cells
**** HCL
***** [[/Users/tshanno/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Preview/Documents/Screen Shot 2019-03-04 at 8.25.14 AM.png][Mechanism of H+ secretion]]
***** alkaline tide when HCl secretion is stimulated because HCO3 is transported across basolateral membranek
**** "intrinsice facktor" - protects vitamin B12
***** endopeptidase
***** [[/Users/tshanno/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Preview/Documents/Screen Shot 2019-03-04 at 8.34.16 AM.png][conrtol of acid secretion by parietal cells]]
*** cheif cells
**** pepsinogen 
***** low pH -> pepsin -> more pepsin
***** increased secretion by:
****** gastrin, cholecystokinin, VIP. secretin
****** ACh, beta-agonists
****** acid
**** gastric lipase
*** neuroendocrine cells
**** G cells: gastrin
***** pylorus and duodenum
***** sitmulus:
****** protein in stomach
****** stretch
****** nerves
***** function
****** incr. parietal cell secretion
****** trohic to stomach and sm intest mucosa
****** less important
******* incr. gastric motilitypyloric constriction
******* gall bladder contr
******* colonic mass movements
******* incr. pancreatic secr
**** D cells: somatostatin
**** enterochromaffin-lke cells: histamine, paracrine
*** Control
**** parasymp incr
**** histamine from enterochrom-like via H2 reseceptrs incr
**** gastrin from G cells -> HCL
**** secretin - pepsinogen secretion
** Gastric mucosal barrier
*** HCO3 rich mucus
*** tight junctions between mucosal cells
*** lumenal membrane of mucosal cells is proton impermeable
*** H. pylori
**** grows in acidic enviroment
**** found in 40% of the ppopulation and most patients with ulcers
**** ulcers caused by immune response
** Pancreatic secretion
*** [[/Users/tshanno/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Preview/Documents/Screen Shot 2019-03-04 at 10.38.36 AM.png][Secretory mechanism]] - note that this is the gastic mechanism sort of reversed with the HCO3 going to the lumen and the H+ going to the blood.
*** acid tide from proton transport with increased secretion
*** control by ANS is what youd expect
*** hormonal
**** secretin (duodenal mucosa) - HCO3
***** S cells
***** stimulated by acid in duodenum
***** incr HCO3 in bile as well
***** decr. gastic acid secr
***** trohpic to exocrine pancrea
***** less miportant
****** decr gastric emptying
****** stimulates pepsinogen secr.
**** cholecystokinin (duodenal mucosa)
***** stimulates enzyme secretions and is therefore the most important
***** I cells - duodenum and jejunum
***** stimuls:
****** fat/proteins in duodenum
****** nerves
***** also causes gall bladder contraction
***** inhibits gastic emtying
***** trophic to exocrine pancreas
***** less important
****** decr gastric acid
****** incr pepsinogen secr
****** stimulates bile secr
****** relaxation of Sphincter of Oddi
**** gastin, substance P, VIP - less potent
** Intestinal secretion stimulated by:
*** increased inttralumenal pressure (food)
*** vasoactive intestinal paptide (VIP)
*** toxins like cholera -> diarrhea
** GIP: gastric inhibitory peptide
*** K cells in duodenum and jejunum
*** stimulus:
**** fat, glucose
**** acid
**** hypertonicity
**** distension
*** inhibits gastic acid secr
*** stimulates insulin secr
*** inhibits gastric emptying (pyloric constriction)
** Stomach
*** pyloric relaxaton and incr. gastric emptying
**** VIP
**** NO
**** inhibited by vagal fibers
*** pyloric constriction
**** cholecystekinin
**** GIP
**** gastrin

*** Alter Activity 3 in Gallsone case (Lisa Rodriguez):  
SCHEDULED: <2020-01-03 Fri>
**** Add more explanation to feedback inhibition in table, especially regarding rapid weight loss. incr. lipolysis -> increased cholesterol -> feeds into bile salt sythesis pathway -> incr. cholic acid -> body "thinks" there's too much bile -> cholic acid feedsback and inhibits bile synthesis -> cholesterol ppt aand stone formation
**** Cholesterol stimulates bile synthesis so the end result is a balance between cholesterol and choic acid.  Too much cholic acid -> stones

*** Went through the student comments with Deri.  The reviews were disappointing and he will make changes for next year.  These will be:
**** Re-write notes using complete sentences.
***** DONE [#A] Send Deri one of the VF cardiovascular lessons to look at.  
Maybe both the Heart Lesson (Levis style) and the Structure and function notes which were converted from the Joel Michale style.
**** Make sure all of the figures used in the videos aare in the notes.
***** DONE [#A] I need to makes sure that the heart failure case figues from the videos get added to my own heart notes

**** CANCELED Re-write summative questions and maybe formative questions to make them consistent with each other and of the same difficulty.
**** Re-record videos standing in front of the camera
***** Record video with Deri <2019-05-15 Wed 13:30-14:30>
*** Deri's personal problems with his wife and kids being in Kansas City aren't helping here.  The impression I got is that he is definitley planning to join them eventually.  He feels like he needs to leave Rush in order to jump start his research career.  I can't help him iwht that but I can with the teaching.  I don't think I have to plan on him leaving any time soon.
