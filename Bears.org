** DONE [#C] [[https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-salary-cap-free-agency-khalil-mack-biggs-20190312-story.html]] It seems unlikely the Bears will make a splash addition, even as running back Le’Veon Bell remains on the market. Former Seahawks running back Mike Davis figures to be featured prominently in the offense, and the space created by the bookkeeping could prove to be for a few more smaller moves and then for the operating space the team will require for the season. Keep in mind that an extension for center Cody Whitehair could become a business item general manager Ryan Pace attacks during the summer.

Agreed that and safety

What gives? Do you think Gould is playing hardball with the 49ers? – Rory W., Dallas

San Francisco signed Jonathan Brown last week, a move that looks like a depth addition to me more than anything else. Brown was in training camp with the Bengals for the previous three summers but has never played in a regular-season game. The Niners didn’t sign him to replace Gould or even challenge him. I wouldn’t look into the move beyond that. The only hardball Gould can play with the Niners is decline to sign the franchise tag offer. My guess is Gould will use the tag to try to negotiate a multi-year contract with the club. San Francisco is motivated to keep Gould as its kicker.

It’s not impossible that they just want someone in case Gould gets hurt during the year. 
** DONE [#C] [[https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-mailbag-justin-houston-nfl-free-agency-20190312-story.html]] What is keeping Adam Shaheen from ascending to become a more productive tight end? Speed? Agility? Strength? Technique? Toughness? Durability? Football Intelligence? — @rto58

Durability is the No. 1 issue right now. Shaheen was injured late in his rookie season shortly after his playing time was increased due to injuries to others at the position. Then, he lost the first half of his second season when he was injured in preseason in August. He’s got to get more time on the practice field and more game reps to improve. He’s never going to be a speed guy and comparisons to Rob Gronkowski have been wildly off base since Day 1. That doesn’t mean Shaheen cannot be a productive player for the Bears and right now, he’s in line for a much greater role after Dion Sims was released. The Bears will be leaning on Shaheen to give them more as a run blocker unless they go out and sign another Y tight end or draft one. It’s my belief the Bears liked Nick Boyle but knew the market was going to get too big for him for them to be involved. He wound up re-signing with the Ravens for three years at $6 million per season.

To my eye the TEs and rbs in the draft look pretty good. 
** DONE [#C] [[https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/buster-skrine-bears-solid-drafting-finally-puts-free-agency-in-supporting-role/]] Regardless of what happens in free agency, the Bears’ chances of taking the next step in the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl are predicated on growth from within:

1. Mitch Trubisky and the offense parlaying a foundation year in 2018 into a quantum leap in 2019 — with or without running back Jordan Howard. The storylines of better communication, improved chemistry, reacting instead of thinking and Trubisky’s ability to read the defense instead of setting the offense will be over-written and tiresome by training camp. But nobody the Bears add on offense is going to change that scenario.

2. The defense avoiding a significant drop-off  — and potentially improving — in the transition from Vic Fangio to Chuck Pagano. Even without nickel back Bryce Callahan and safety Adrian Amos, the Bears still have 10 starters returning on defense. And that includes four 25-and-under players who should be better in 2019 no matter who is coaching them: linebacker Roquan Smith (22), safety Eddie Jackson (25), nose tackle Eddie Goldman (25) and defensive lineman Bilal Nichols (23 on Sept. 14).

Don’t underestimate health as a factor. 
** DONE [#C] [[https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/03/12/in-trading-big-time-receivers-giants-did-much-better-than-the-steelers/]] The Steelers got a third-round pick and a fifth-round pick for Antonio Brown. The Giants got a lot more than that for Odell Beckham Jr.
The reasons for the differences are obvious. First, the Steelers made it clear that they wanted to move on from Brown. The Giants, in contrast, insisted that they were keeping him. And the “we’ll keep him” posture often becomes the best leverage in trade talks.
Second, Antonio Brown embarked on a scorched earth/bleached ‘stache effort to get out of town. Beckham had engaged in no similar campaign to be traded.
It adds up to the Browns giving up a lot more to get Beckham (a one, a three, and Jabrill Peppers) than the Raiders gave up to get Brown, because the Giants were committed to perpetuating the ruse that under no circumstances would they trade him. The Giants played it the right way, and the Steelers simply didn’t

Point is well taken. But Pittsburgh devalued Brown with the way they handled his late season antics. They should have promised a trade before it ever got to Browns scortched earth policy. 
** DONE [#C]  https://theathletic.com/867055/2019/03/14/film-study-what-the-bears-are-getting-in-running-back-mike-davis/

This clip against the Cardinals shows him again following the set-up of his blocks while pressing the line of scrimmage. He gets defenders to commit to him, before sliding away to gain extra yards. This run also shows another standout trait — his contact balance, which has to do with his compact build and lower center of gravity at 5-foot-9 and 217 pounds.

He’s a lesser version of the 2017 Jordan Howard. He’s low to the ground and will be tough inside but he’s not fast. He’s not a weapon.

Cost-efficient. Pace has overpaid in free agency, whether it’s reaching (Pernell McPhee) or filling needs (Trey Burton). With a solid roster, he got more value than you normally get in free agency and filled key holes at nickel and safety while still leaving room for inevitable extensions to keep the core intact.

Hmmmm.  I’m not so sure. I think he still overpaid for guys like Davis. It’s just that they were smaller amount of money for minor additions.

As I understand it, Callahan’s camp made it known they were expecting a contract that averaged between $7-8 million per season. When the Bears learned that, they moved on, and that process led them to Skrine. Callahan would up getting a contract that averages $7 million per season from the Broncos, and the Bears landed Skrine on a contract that averages $5.5 million per year.

The Bears had to place a value on Callahan, and nobody knows him better than they do. They would have loved to have him back, but I don’t think they wanted to pay him more than what they paid for Skrine. Let’s see how Skrine performs with better talent around him in the secondary and a better pass rush than he played with for the Jets and Browns.

My question exactly.

I’m not sure what was wrong but it was affecting his vision as well. That probably decreased his value.

Personally not too happy about this trade. I have to assume whatever was wrong was physical and that after an off season of rest and whatever else he could come back and be the 2017 version of himself. Which was pretty good.

The trade probably has more to do with the fact that he didn’t fit the offense. In particular he wasn’t much at catching passes out of the back field. I liked him though and overall I have a feeling this was a mistake.

Will the Bears trade up to draft a running back? - Chicago Tribune]] Just wanted to get your thoughts on the Jordan Howard trade. Did Ryan Pace and Matt Nagy try to get a little too cute? I get he didn't fit what they wanted at that position. However, isn't it ironic that he can fit Doug Pederson's system in Philadelphia, which is basically what Nagy is running? Also, I realize they were not going to get a third- or fourth-round pick for Howard, however why didn't they at least try to hold on to him through training camp, when a team might be desperate for a running back because of injury. They possibly could get at least a fifth-round pick then. The fact they didn't get a pick for him in the 2019 draft just baffles me. It also reduces depth at the position, although it is likely they will draft one now. — Tom T., Parts Unknown

Some readers were not particularly happy with the trade, but only those who haven’t been paying attention were surprised. I’m not sure what you mean by get too cute with the transaction. The Bears took a look at the teams they thought could be in the market for a running back and found one in the Eagles. Based on the compensation they received — a sixth-round pick in 2020 that can improve to a fifth-rounder in 2020 if Howard performs well — there wasn’t much market for him. I have been writing since before last season that Howard’s trade value was going to be lower than most people figured, and it got worse after a disappointing season. Reality is the Bears were going to release Howard if they couldn’t find a taker for him. Some readers won’t believe that, but you don’t take a starting running back and put him behind a new addition in Mike Davis and potentially a new draft pick and pay him $2 million as the No. 3.

You make a good point — the Eagles run a very similar offense. Pederson leans on the running game a little bit more than Nagy, and the Eagles were looking for a back for the role LeGarrette Blount filled during their 2017 Super Bowl season. The bottom line is Howard was popular with Bears fans, but around the league he was never considered an elite running back.

The Bears traded Deiondre’ Hall to the Eagles for a seventh-rounder last year. Jordan Howard was a starter and Hall was basically a special teams player. That just looks odd on paper, so how was their trade “value” determined? — Petrie P., Parts Unknown

Well, the Eagles traded for Hall when he had two years remaining on his rookie contract and got Howard with only one year remaining on his deal. The escalator in Howard’s contract kicked in, too, so he’s going to make $2.025 million this season, more than Hall. It might look “odd,” but some folks I spoke to didn’t think the Bears would be able to find a taker for Howard based on his rough 2018 season and limited ball-catching ability. Combine that with the bump in salary and the fact he’s a one-year rental and it adds up to minimal trade value.

Will the Bears trade up to draft a running back? - Chicago Tribune]] With Aaron Lynch signed, will the Bears still target pass rushers in the draft? — @grant_seeds

I don’t think any team ever enters a draft and says, “We’re not going to look at pass rushers.” The old saying is there is no such thing as having too many pass rushers. That said, you’re not going find refined pass rushers or guys with traits that check most of the boxes by the middle rounds. If they see a pass rusher they really like, I wouldn’t rule it out. But I figure running back, cornerback and safety are positions they will have more interest in and I never rule out offensive linemen.

It’s a good draft for tight ends.

Will the Bears trade up to draft a running back? - Chicago Tribune]] We often saw Mitch Trubisky overthrow wide open receivers. What can you tell us about what he’s doing to improve his accuracy? — @dg122985

Accuracy is something football folks will tell you a quarterback either has or doesn’t have. Guys who aren’t accurate from the start usually don’t become super accurate. The good news is Trubisky set the Bears’ single-season record for completion percentage last year at 66.6. Yes, he missed some open guys downfield. Trubisky has worked with wide receivers this offseason, which could help when they get back to Halas Hall. It was a new offense for everyone last year, and with the players not having to go through that process again, you would expect things to be a little more crisp. That could make him more accurate.

Hell be more comfortable and that may make him more accurate. Remember he was known for accuracy in college.

None of it was a physical thing,” Nagy said of Trubisky’s errant throws. “It was all just him learning where to go with the ball. See, your clock goes so fast that everything you see … Boom! Ball’s out. You know? When you know what’s going on and things become slower, you can make that more accurate throw. None of it was physical. It was all just mentally learning the offense. And the other guys too. Sometimes the quarterback makes a throw and it looks like it’s a bad throw or a poor throw, but it was a terrible route.”

Couldn’t agree more. Highlight accuracy later in the season.

Indianapolis would be a good spot except for one thing. It’s far enough north to make weather a problem. 

When Radio City Music Hall left the draft four years ago, Chicago lobbied hard to be the new permanent home. But anyone who looked out the window at the heavy snow coming down in Saturday, the last day of the draft, had to agree that the the NFL made the right decision when they started rotating cities instead. 

Indianapolis isn't that far south of Chicago.

\begin{quote}
``He’s a really good inside-zone runner. He has a good feel, especially in the shotgun, of just how the zone moves and how things feel, which is probably why Coach [\textbf{Matt}] \textbf{Nagy} and Coach [\textbf{Mark}] \textbf{Helfrich} and those guys were really interested.

``It was funny. There were a lot of teams interested in David, but the teams that seemed to be the most interested all came from that same tree. It was the Chiefs, Bears, Eagles, the Colts. Those coaches that came from that same tree, they have a bunch of gun runs that they run really well.''
\end{quote}

It's worth noting that the Bears were likely trading up to get ahead of the Bills, who were evidently looking for a running back and selected Florida Atlantic's \textbf{Devin Singletary} with the pick after Chicago's.  So there was likely something of a consensus amongst a lot of teams that he was the next best running back on the board.  Certainly the Bears suspected that the Bills would have taken him.

This article is worth reading.  There was a lot of good information beyond the usual hype.

  ``Does \textbf{Adam Shaheen} have a future with the Bears? Plagued by injuries first two seasons, I’m wondering if they’ll go in different direction, especially with capable free agents like the guy from Utah State. — @chuckietwoglove

``I can tell you that when \textbf{Matt Nagy} was asked about Shaheen at the NFL owners meeting, he was very positive. There is no question durability has been an issue with Shaheen, and if he can stay on the field, the Bears believe he can really help the offense. Let’s tap the brakes on the idea he will be replaced from the get-go by \textbf{Dax Raymond}, the undrafted rookie from Utah State. The Bears like Raymond and believe he has a chance to stick, otherwise they would not have guaranteed him $45,000 ($15,000 signing bonus with \$30,000 base-salary guarantee). But 32 teams passed on Raymond in the draft. The Bears still have an investment of a draft pick, money and maybe most importantly time in Shaheen. They’re not cutting the cord on him now.''
\end{quote}

One of the bigger surprises of the Bears draft has to be that they didn't draft a tight end from what looked like a deep class in the middle rounds.  The Bears have evidently decided to roll with Shaheen.  Raymond will evidently compete to back him up with an unsigned free agent.

Despite Nagy's comments, that second, inline tight end position has to be an area of mild concern.  Setting aside the fact that he can't stay healthy, Shaheen hasn't shown anything but potential, yet.

Yes, if you are a reporter.  Maybe not if you are a general manager.

I actually didn't think this was a bad question (no surprise given that it was mine).

\textbf{Gregg Rosenthal} at \textit{NFL.com} \href{https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-around-the-league-podcast/id680904259}{comments upon the Bears} during their ``Around the NFL'' podcast (episode title: ``Around the NFC'', at the 24:45 mark).

Rosenthal mentions his distrust of teams that stand pat after a successful season and expect that roster to come back and perform at the same level (at the 24:45 mark).  Not that the Bears had much choice, as he acknowledges.

I share Rosenthal's mistrust.  This didn't work in 2007 with the Bears coming off of a Super Bowl appearance and it probably won't work this year, at least for the defense.  As was the case in 2006, the Bears were among the healthiest teams in the league last year, something that is unlikely to happen a second time in a row.  They also lost most of the defensive coaching staff.

But the reasons for this wariness go deeper than that.  Last year with a new head coach the players were less comfortable and likely for the most part concentrated harder on what was going on.  This year with the stink of success on them, at least a certain percentage of the players are likely to be more relaxed.  This can lead to a drop in performance.

In fairness, unlike 2007, the Bears have reason to believe that their offense will be better in a second year in head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy}'s system.  This is their best hope to maintain excellence in the coming season.

\begin{quote}
Q: ``Gotta build up that friendship with \textbf{James} [\textbf{Danels}] now.''

A: ``Ha, yeah, got to. James knows. I’m talking to James even more. He’s like, 'Why is Mitch talking to me all the time?' I was like, 'You’re my center now, bro, let’s do it.'''
\end{quote}

The Bears haven't announced it, yet, but this apparently let's the catch out of the bag.  I gather from this that \textbf{Cody Whitehair} is switching positions with Daniels with Whitehair moving to left guard.

It's a risky switch.  Daniels will undoubtedly be better at center but Whitehair was a Pro Bowl caliber center who was still getting better.  Whether the unit overall is be better with this switch will be one of the more interesting questions early in the season.

\textbf{Mark Potash} at the \textit{Chicago Sun-Times} \href{https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/first-and-10-bears-could-hit-the-jackpot-with-motivated-wr-emanuel-hall/}{quotes new Bears wide receiver \textbf{Emanuel Hall}} on his motivation after being passed over in the NFL draft.  Hall was expected to go as high as the second round:

\begin{quote}
  ``'I promise you it’s a feeling that I’ll never forget. That was one of the worst feelings ever, being undrafted,' Hall said at Bears rookie mini-camp Saturday. 'It felt like the longest three days of my life. I had a draft party on the second day and the third day you’re just shaking everybody’s hand, ‘Thanks for coming.’ — no one wants to do that.'''
  
``Hall’s speed (4.39 in the 40) and big-play ability made him an intriguing prospect in the draft. He averaged 23.5 yards per catch in his final two years at Missouri (70 receptions, 1,645 yards, 14 touchdowns in 22 games), with nine receptions of 50 yards or more.

``But a history of minor injuries that kept him out of four games last season and prevented him from playing in the Senior Bowl played a part in getting overlooked in the draft.''
\end{quote}

Hall fell out of the draft due to concerns about his football character.  Specifically, coaches at the University of Missouri were very up front about Hall's inability to play through those minor injuries that Potash mentions.  In fact, Hall missed the last day of rookie minicamp with an injury.  \textbf{Kenvin Fishbain} at \textit{The Athletic} elaborates:

\begin{quote}
  ``Hall battled hamstring issues and a groin injury last season, but instead of shutting it down, returned to finish off the season and play in the bowl game. Even though he got back on the field, the injury required maintenance in the winter, preventing him from playing in the Senior Bowl, and it almost kept him from performing at the combine.

  ``Doctors in Indianapolis told Hall not to participate in drills because of a possible sports hernia. Hall signed a waiver so he could run and jump, and while not at 100 percent, he ran a 4.39 40 and had the best broad jump recorded for a wide receiver at the combine (11 feet, nine inches).''

  ``Nagy discussed, though, how the Bears are confident in their staff to help with players who may have had durability issues in college.
  
``'There’s some elements to that in regards to our training program is going to be different than every other training program from other teams that they come from,' he said. 'We feel really good about \textbf{Andre Tucker} and what he does and our staff that he has, our strength staff, \textbf{Jenn (Gibson)} our sports dietician. And so we feel really good about when we bring people in here, we really sometimes don’t care as much about what happened in the past — what can we do now? Let’s fix it, let’s give him a clean slate and let’s roll.”
\end{quote}

Speed and ability aren't enough.  Apparently Hall is going to have to toughen up.  Otherwise he'll be just another track star that didn't make it.

\begin{quote}
Reading about all the early draftee signings, I remember a time when \textbf{Cliff Stein} was first to get the Bears draft class under contract. Lately it seems they’ve been bringing up the rear. What happened? — Greg M.

What’s the race? The NFL has slotted the bonus money and salaries for draft picks. There’s no advantage to completing this right away. I have no doubt the Bears will have all five draft picks under contract before training camp begins.
\end{quote}

I'm pretty sure the agent was mostly to blame for the Bears troubles signing first round pick \textbf{Roquon Smith} last year.  Nevertheless, one does wonder if the Bears could have settled the issues with him sooner had they been further along with negotiations when camp started.

Biggs asks ``What's the race?'' and that's fair.  But my question is, ``Why wait?''.  Get the rookies under contract so that they can workout without fear of injury.

In any case, with their first pick coming in the third round, I doubt the Bears will have a great deal of trouble signing their picks before camp this year.

\begin{quote}
Is \textbf{Brad Childress} under contract for the full season or just the preseason like last year? What role will he play with the offense? — @_d_r_r_

The Bears hired Childress as a senior offensive assistant, and he will be around for the entire season. He was hired as a consultant last year, working with Matt Nagy from the start of his tenure and through most of the preseason. He’ll be available as a sounding board for Nagy and will have input across the board on offense. Nagy is big on taking input from all of his coaches, and Childress will be part of that mix.
\end{quote}

If you look back at the history of this blog, you'll find that I had some rough things to say about Childress as a head coach for the Vikings.  But I like him in this role.  He's from Chicago and at this point in his career he probably wants to be here.  He's experienced in a way that Nagy isn't and there's very little doubt in my mind that he'll say what he thinks at times when maybe other assistants will hold back a little.  

But there's one other under looked factor here that could be of great benefit to Nagy and the Bears.  Childress has traditionally been a ``run first'' offensive coach.  He knows how to run the ball and that knowledge could be handy on a team where Nagy has constantly said that the running game has to get better.  Childress could help contribute to a big improvement in that area.

\href{https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-mailbag-receivers-kicker-competition-20190508-story.html}{Another good question} for Biggs:

\begin{quote}
``Should the Bears pursue \textbf{Ndamukong Suh}? I think that would be a great addition. — @chiwest773

Teams can now sign free agents such as Suh without that transaction affecting the formula for compensatory draft picks, so we could begin to see some movement for some of the name players who remain on the street. Suh is in that category, as is offensive tackle \textbf{Jared Veldheer}, who is reported to be signing with the Patriots. I don’t believe the Bears are planning to spend big money on any players not on the roster. It’s possible offensive lineman \textbf{Cody Whitehair}, who’s eligible for a contract extension, is the only player who will get a significant payday between now and the end of the season.
\end{quote}

Suh would actually be a good fit for the Bears strictly in terms of what he can still do on the field.  At this point in his career he can still be a big, two gapping defensive lineman who will stop the run while giving a little bit of pass rush.  But he's nowhere near the player he was earlier in his career the last time Bears fans saw him on a regular basis with the Lions.  Suh is 32 years old and the Bears have trended towards younger free agents since general manager \textbf{Ryan Pace} joined the organization.  He's also not a great culture fit.

Whether Suh signs with the Bears or anyone else will come down to money.  My guess is that no one is going to make him a big money offer at this point.  As Biggs points out, the Bears almost certainly won't.  A lot will depend on whether Suh still wants to play the game for considerably less than he's used to making.

\textbf{Brad Biggs} at the \textit{Chicago Tribune} \href{https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-mailbag-receivers-kicker-competition-20190508-story.html}{answers your questions}:

\begin{quote}
  ``Do you see the Bears signing any veteran pass rushers now that it won’t impact their comp picks? If yes, who? — @mellothunder

``This has been a consistent question throughout the offseason, even after the team re-signed veteran outside linebacker \textbf{Aaron Lynch}, and I’m a little puzzled why. The Bears tied for third in the league with 50 sacks last season. Only three of those 50 sacks were by players no longer on the team: Nickel cornerback \textbf{Bryce Callahan} had two and strong safety \textbf{Adrian Amos} had one. With \textbf{Khalil Mack} being paid as one of the top edge rushers in the game and with investments elsewhere when it comes to rushing the passer, I think the Bears are OK here. I can’t see them spending a lot of money for another player to add to the mix.''
\end{quote}

I think I understand why.  On some level fans probably recognize that the Bears depth is likely to be challenged more this year and they are worried about it with only Mack, \textbf{Leonard Floyd} and Lynch as reliable pass rushers.

Personally I'm not as worried about ti for two reasons.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Not many teams have good starting pass rushers, let alone depth at th position.  Good pass rushers don't grow on trees and anyone who is any good was signed to a roster a long time ago, compensatory formula or not.
\item I like \textbf{Kylie Fits} and \textbf{Isaiah Irving} a lot more than most people and think one or both could step up and do a decent job if called upon.
\end{enumerate}

It will be interesting to see how the depth at the position plays out this year.

 \begin{quote}
 Wiederer: Do you see any limitations in his game or areas he’s going to have to either really work on or work around to be reliable at the NFL level?

 Kiffin:  Pass protection. With the bigger players on that level, that’ll be more of a challenge. And being the backup here, it’s not like he got a million reps on film of that. So that’s going to be something he’ll have to work at if they’re going to want to use him on third down especially.
 \end{quote}

 No surprise there.  No team will put a running back out on the field who is going to get the quarterback killed.  Kiffin, a former head coach of the Oakland Raiders, would know that as well as anyone.  And most good college running backs haven't been asked to do it much. 

 The good news is that Kiffin thinks Whyte is a really good pass receiver.  But the bet here is that if Whyte sees the field much for the Bears his rookie year, it will be as a kick returner, a position that he excels at.

\begin{quote}
Rowe:  ``To bring you back to that last game (his junior year), we had a staff meeting and we were trying to talk about guys who could come over and help us because our numbers were down.

``The receivers coach and the head coach were like: Stephen Denmark needs to be over there. They were trying to sell us on: You should see the way he gets out of breaks. He’s 6-2 and can get out of breaks as well as all our small guys. So his feet are really good.

``Just naturally, him coming over to a new position, he’d have to get better at backpedaling and all that, which we didn’t do a lot of that. He was able to do it; it just took some time and work. He busted his (tail) and got it done.''

Campbell:  ``So did he play with a lot of vision, backed off a bit?''

Rowe:  ``No, we played majority press coverage. Turn and run with a guy. There were some situations where he did play a bail third, and he did a pretty good job with that stuff.''
\end{quote}

I'm really wondering why the offensive coaches pushed for Denmark to make this switch.  Big, athletic wide receivers presumably don't' grow on trees, especially at Valdosta State.  My conclusion is that it my have had to do with his hands and his ability to catch the ball.

The picture that Campbell and Rowe paint is of a very raw prospect who hasn't done much other than press coverage, a technique that requires athleticism with very little knowledge of the defense or of the awareness that is necessary to play other techniques.

Bottom line, Denmark only played a year at cornerback at a low level college.  Bears fans probably shouldn't expect an immediate contribution as he probably has a long way to go.  Making the roster would likely be an accomplishment for him.

At 6-4, 225 pounds Horsted was listed as a wide receiver at Princeton.  He will likely compete to back up \textbf{Trey Burton} at the U-tight end rather than at the in-line blocking Y-tight end position.

The latter is a weak spot in the Bears offense as \textbf{Adam Shaheen} tries to break out in his third year with the Bears.  Shaheen hasn't developed in part because his career to this point has been marred by injuries.

Right now Shaheen's primary competition comes in the form of veteran back up \textbf{Ben Braunecker} and undrafted free agents \textbf{Ian Bunting} and \textbf{Dax Raymond}.

One can only conclude that the Bears are a lot more comfortable about Shaheen being given this job than many of the fans are.

\begin{quote}
``Multiple judges have ruled that the “sneak and peek” video surveillance violated the law by undertaking no effort to minimize the intrusion on the privacy of innocent persons who were simply getting massages. If the appellate courts don’t overturn these rulings, there will be little or no evidence against Kraft — unless prosecutors can persuade the alleged providers of prostitution to “flip” on their alleged customers.''
\end{quote}

I have no interest in this case except that it bothers me when someone tries to legally get off the hook based upon technicalities.  I know he did it.  You know he did it.  The lawyers know he did it.

Kraft is the owner of a franchise where players are constantly told to be accountable for their actions.  Is this accountability?  It might be the reality of the world we live it.  But I call it hypocrisy.

In any case, the situation \href{https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/05/16/if-robert-kraft-is-exonerated-what-happens-next/}{puts the league in a bind}.  They  haven't hesitated to suspend players who are obviously guilty but who have not been legally convicted, often because they paid off the victim.  Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Roethlisberger#Sexual_assault_allegations}{2010 suspension after sexual assault allegations} is a good example.

I think its fair to say that although the league has some morally upright fans who strongly disapprove, solicitation isn't really considered to be a big deal to most in modern American society.  It certainly doesn't rise to the level of sexual assault or similar offenses.  But in terms of obvious guilt or innocence beyond the legal ramifications, there are players who are going to be watching this situation closely to see if Kraft is held to the same standard.

``It’s easy to view [the approach] as obsessive, if not excessive. While it’s clearly important for a team to find a reliable kicker, the way the Bears are setting up this search also puts the job in more of a spotlight than it naturally brings. Now, as soon as the next poor soul to hold that job misses a kick and the Bears lose a game, he’ll become the focus of the larger failure. They made Parkey a pariah, partly for the miss and partly for his television appearance in the aftermath, and now they’re ensuring his replacement will be under even more pressure.''
\end{quote}

You won't find many people that are too sympathetic in this situation.  If you have a kicker line up for a game winner in a Super Bowl, you would be hard pressed to find a situation more pressure packed.  You'd like to have a guy in that role that you are confident in.  I think most people will have a hard time criticizing the Bears for doing everythig they can to make sure that they have a guy who will react the right way.

Count me among those critical of the Bears use of Mizzell in any situation last year.  Sixty nine snaps is plenty enough to get on people's radar and, like many observers, I couldn't figure out why he was on the field at all.  It was evident to me that he just wasn't that good.

You wonder why the Bears don’t just release Mizzell. There must be something about him that someone likes, probably head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy}. He’s going to be a practice squad project at wide receiver and you wonder if that spot would be better used on someone else and if Mizzell, himself, would be better off going elsewhere without the position change where he’ll have a better chance to play.

It’s nice that this is on Townsend’s mind. In the few bad games the Bears defense had last year the tackling was horrendous. See \href{http://bearingthenews.com/blog/2018/10/14/quick-game-comments-bears-dolphins-101418/}{my comments on the Miami loss after the bye week} as a good example.

\begin{quote}
``'I feel like I can improve in a lot of areas,' Smith said.

``If we’re nitpicking, Smith needs to improve in coverage, but that should come through his own experiences, including in practices against running backs \textbf{Tarik Cohen} and \textbf{David Montgomery}. There is a significant difference between seeing an option route from a back on film and handling one at game speed.

``When [inside linebackers coach \textbf{Mark}] \textbf{DeLeone} evaluated Smith’s rookie film, he saw a young linebacker who started to shake off the 'rust' and improve as the weeks went by.''
\end{quote}

That's not nitpicking.  It was a serious problem and it wasn't just Smith.  The Bears were constantly getting burned last season as receivers dragged across the middle of the field where the inside linebackers failed to pick them up in coverage.

In fairness, it doesn't look like it's particularly easy to do.  I would imagine that it's tough enough to be completely aware of what's going on in front of you let alone of opposing players coming at you on routes from the side and slightly behind you.  Nevertheless, that's what these guys get paid to do.

Not to beat a dead horse but as DeLeone points out, you have to feel that Smith would have done a better job of getting on top of this had his agent not held him out.  Here's hoping that with a full offseason Smith, along with the other linebackers, does a better job of correcting this issue.

\begin{quote}
  ``'I think the sacks will come,' Monachino said. 'I think Leonard as a pure natural pass rusher has a bigger toolbox than anybody else I’m coaching right now. I want everybody to understand what I just said. The better rusher right now is No. 52. But the natural pass-rush ability, the pass-rush gene, No. 94 has it. As he gets better at one or two things, his numbers will go up. The thing that may happen first are the effective rushes.'''

  ``'This is a rare athlete playing the position.  There’s a whole bunch of guys that are great hammers and guys that have the pass-rush gene that have that dominant trait. This is a rare athlete for the position. I’ve coached a bunch of good ones. I’ve coached big ones, I’ve coached smart ones, I’ve coached fast ones. I’ve never coached an athlete like this.

  ``'… His length. His short-area quickness. Long speed. The ability to cover and change direction. All of those things are very special with this player.'''

  ``'He is more than willing to learn any way he can learn.   He’s learning on his own because he asks me great questions every day when he gets back into the building after he’s watched tape on his own. I think that the guy has a very, very high ceiling.'''
\end{quote}

The quotes show the difference between the current staff under new defensive coordinator \textbf{Chuck Pagano} and the understated style that former head coach \textbf{John Fox} and coordinator \textbf{Vic Fangio}.  ``Under promise and over deliver'' doesn't seem to be in anyone's mantra in May, that's for sure.

Personally, I like the Fox/Fangio way of handling these things.  Raising expectations to high level sets players that might otherwise be very solid up for what might be perceived as disappointing results.

There is a reason why Floyd hasn't been a great player on the field entering his third year.  True, he might bloom this year.  But I think setting him up to be more than he's shown that he is to this point might be unfair.

\begin{quote}
  ``With the Ravens hiring a new offensive coordinator this year, it probably shouldn't have come as a surprise to anyone in Baltimore that the team would be installing a new offense this offseason, but apparently, no one told Lamar Jackson.
  
``When Jackson showed up for the team's first round of offseason training activities (OTAs) last week, the Ravens quarterback literally had no idea that he was going to be spending his week implementing a new offense. 

``'Coming in, I didn't know we would have a totally different offense,' Jackson admitted, via the Ravens' official website. 'When I got here, coach was like, 'Yea, we have a totally new system. You're going to have go through this and that.' It's been getting to me a little bit.'''
\end{quote}

I'm completely torn on this article.  I don't know what is worse, having a quarterback who didn't move to find out if the offense would be different or having a coordinator who didn't tell him.

One thing is for sure.  Communication was definitely lacking.  I can't believe that the team didn't have the new offensive coordinator talking to the player to at least that extent.  And I can't believe that the player wasn't demanding to talk to the offensive coordinator to make sure they were on the same page and that he would be prepared for workouts.

Baltimore has a well-deserved reputation for being a well-run organization.  But it looks like multiple people dropped the ball here.  Its not that they can't recover from a slow start in May.  But that fact that it happened at all isn't a great sign of things to come.

\begin{quote}
``How will \textbf{Buster Skrine} fit into the Bears defense to replace \textbf{Bryce Callahan}? A lot of fans have been calling him a downgrade. — @sam_gutterman

``Skrine projects to be a good fit. He didn’t have his best season last year with the Jets, but the struggles came mostly when he was forced to play on the outside because of injuries. Skrine has also been more durable than Callahan. He has missed a total of five games over the last three seasons but didn’t miss a single game in his first five seasons in the league. Durability was a knock on Callahan, who wound up getting more money from the Broncos than the Bears wanted to pay. I like the idea of adding a proven veteran at the nickel spot with Callahan departed. Skrine will be better than he was with the Jets because he has a much more talented pass rush in front of him.''
\end{quote}

I don't think many people locally are calling the addition of Skrine a downgrade.  Head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy} highlighted Skrine last year before the Bears played the Jets as one of their best players and its obvious that they signed him largely because of what they saw on tape in preparation for that game.

The one thing to keep in mind is that Skrine is 30 years old.  That means he might be a good fill in for a while but he's also not the future at that position.  The Bears drafted \textbf{Duke Shelly} out of Kansas State in the sixth round but I wouldn't hold my breath that he'll work out there as a starter.  Although he's reportedly a fine athlete, he's only 5'9''.  Admittedly you don't need the height playing nickel back that you do if you are playing on the outside but Shelly will still have to show that he can overcome that lack of height to cover taller receivers on the inside.

Losses of the Bryce Callahan-type are inevitable in the salary cap era of the NFL and as those types of losses go, Callahan isn't a huge one.  But I would say that the loss of Callahan did leave a hole on the defense long-term and that the Bears will be spending some time as they approach the draft for the next year or two looking for potential replacements.

\begin{quote}
``Why move \textbf{Bradley Sowell} to tight end? There’s much less depth at tackle than there is at tight end to begin with. Now with Sowell at tight end, he has no shot at making the roster with \textbf{Trey Burton}, \textbf{Adam Shaheen}, \textbf{Ben Braunecker} and \textbf{Dax Raymond} ahead of him. Why not just keep him at swing tackle? — @bearsest1920

``For starters, I don’t think the Bears would have shifted Sowell if they didn’t feel pretty good about their options at swing tackle. \textbf{Rashaad Coward} was the first player coach Matt Nagy mentioned when I asked about that position last week after Sowell’s position switch was revealed. \textbf{Cornelius Lucas} might be another option. He has eight career starts and was once a relatively well-regarded prospect for the Lions. The thing you’re missing here is the Bears want Sowell at tight end because of his blocking ability. You’re right. He doesn’t offer as much in the passing game as the tight ends you referenced. None of those tight ends can block as well as Sowell, however, and they felt they were a little light at the Y position, which is a blocking tight end. Sowell essentially was a blocking tight end last season when the Bears would bring him in to play in heavy packages and he reported as eligible. The odds might be stacked against him to make the final roster, but I would not rule it out.
\end{quote}

I'm going to completely disagree with the questioner here and even mildly disagree with Biggs.

For whatever reason the Bears decided not to draft a tight end this year despite the fact that the depth at the position was pretty good, at least as far as the larger blocking-type go.  Raymond is 245 pounds which would probably make him more of an option to back up Burton at the move tight end unless he gains some weight.   The Bears seem to be banking heavily that Shaheen will take a step forward here in that respect.

Moving Sowell to tight end gives them another option to back up Shaheen.  But more important, because Sowell can also play tackle, he offers the type of position versatility that might allow the Bears to keep him on the roster where they otherwise might not have.  I'd say he's increased his chances not decreased them with this move.  Indeed, in obvious running situations Sowell will likely be a better option than Shaheen and he might see some playing time.

``Linebacker and defensive tackle depth seem to be biggest needs on defense. Who are the free-agent targets that would best fit? — @jokertownhero


``The Bears have pretty good depth at defensive tackle. Look at \textbf{Eddie Goldman}, \textbf{Bilal Nichols} and \textbf{Akiem Hicks}, who plays inside, and you’re talking about a really talented top three. \textbf{Nick Williams} has been around and he knows the scheme. I disagree that this is an area of need for depth. I also think the Bears are in pretty good shape at linebacker. There aren’t quality pass rushers on the street, and when you have a group headlined by \textbf{Khalil Mack}, \textbf{Leonard Floyd} and \textbf{Aaron Lynch} at outside linebacker, that’s good to me. They’ve got some decent reserves, too, including \textbf{Isaiah Irving}. At inside linebacker, \textbf{Nick Kwiatkoski} and \textsf{Joel Iyiegbuniwe} are behind starters \textbf{Danny Trevathan} and \textbf{Roquan Smith}. \textbf{Josh Woods} is another reserve to keep an eye on. He impressed the team last year as a rookie on the practice field. I don’t see depth issues at these positions.
\end{quote}

The guess here is that the questioner isn’t impressed Nichols and Irving as quality back ups.   A year ago this time I would have agreed with this assessment as lack of depth was one of the reasons I gave for predicting a last place finish for the Bears.  However, I don't agree now.

Irving and Nichols both impressed me in the preseason last year with the progress that they had made in terms of their play.  Both looked to me like they could play in the regular season if a veteran went down and provide average productivity (which is as much as you can ask of a back up).

Both have now had an additional year to develop, with Nichols seeing significant playing time.  That's good because although the Bears depth wasn't tested much last year, it almost certainly will be this year.  They are probably going to need one or both of these players to be able to step in.

Can you give me your perspective of why the national opinion and/or media seem to have a negative view of the Bears? I’m watching clips of Damien Woody and John Fox saying the Bears had the worst offseason. I feel clips like this are the norm, but maybe I’m wrong? Very frustrating. — @schnurlacher1

Former Bears coach John Fox cited the Bears as having the worst offseason of any NFL team during a Monday appearance on ESPN. But he did so after Damien Woody first listed the Bears. Woody cited the loss of defensive coordinator Vic Fangio as a reason for selecting the Bears, which led to considerable turnover in the defensive coaching staff. Fox referenced the unresolved kicker situation, which has more than a few Bears fans nervous. What Fox didn’t mention is that the team terminated the contract of all-time leading scorer Robbie Gould while he was the coach, a move Fox likely could have prevented. Keep a couple of things in mind. For starters, sometimes TV and radio personalities are going to throw out opinions to generate discussion. Second, the Bears were pretty bad for a long stretch, so it’s going to take sustained success for them to generate respect. I wouldn’t get too bothered about Fox or Woody choosing the Bears for having the worst offseason. The Bears didn’t have first- or second-round draft picks. But I think you can fairly say they still had a good offseason and I think they made about the best move possible after Fangio’s exit.

1. Who cares about national media. Local guys like them. Fan bias?

2ntheybdidnt have a good offseason. They’re up against the cap and didn’t have first or second round draft picks. They’re the saints. Get used to it.

So much of properly developing a quarterback has to do with pairing him with the right coaching staff.  You wonder how many of the busts over the last 30 years would have been stars had they been in the proper nurturing environment early on.

In any case Seattle is \textbf{Pete Carroll} is far more likely to adjust to Lynch's skill set.  Not that he's likely to get a chance to show it because quarterback \textbf{Russell Wilson} is a bit of an iron man but it will be interesting to see if Lynch does better there if he gets a chance to show it.

\textbf{Adam Jahns} at \textit{The Athletic} emphasizes that fans \href{https://theathletic.com/1088301/2019/07/21/living-in-the-past-is-a-bears-tradition-but-the-2019-team-is-more-important-than-any-anniversary/?source=rss}{shouldn't let the 100 year anniversary of the Bears overshadow the importance of the 2019 version of the team making progress}.  He particularly emphasizes the importance of quarterback \textbf{Mitch Trubisky}'s continued progress:

\begin{quote}
“The word that comes to mind for me is incremental improvement, steady incremental improvement, and I think we’ve seen (Trubisky) do that,” [general manager \textbf{Ryan}] \textbf{Pace} said Sunday. “And as long as he just keeps on that pace, steady incremental improvement, we’ll be happy. You can feel his confidence growing; we’ve talked about that. Chemistry, continuity, all those things going into Year 2, and that’s going to continue as we go forward.”
\end{quote}

It is important to Note that this continued, steady improvement will be the biggest key to the 2019 season.  Trubisky is one of the most polarizing quarterbacks in the entire league right now.  YOu either really like him or your really, really don't.

Amongst my friends who root for other teams, most of whom are typical, I'd say 80\% will literally tell you that Trubisky is terrible and they don't understand the hype.  And there's good reason for their skepticism.

Even most objective Bears fans would have to admit that Trubisky was league average at best at the end of the year.  And that was, as Pace points out, after making steady progress throughout the 2018 campaign.  Its important to note that expecting anything beyond that is all extrapolation based upon the assumption that he's going to continue to progress

You to have had the opportunity to watch Trubisky make that steady progress last year, game after game, before you could actually get the feeling that he might be on his way to something special.  And what's going to be very interesting about this year is that it won't be just Bears fans who are going to see it.  Trubisky's progress is going to be a national story as the Bears are on national television six times, the maximum allowed.  

Until Trubisky actually shows that he's a very good quarterback,  he's just another guy.  If the Bears are going to remain competitive, he's going to have to become more than that.  Its far from a certainty that will happen.  But either way its going to be what we will all be watching for all over the league this year.

\textbf{Kevin Fishbain} at \textit{The Athletic} says that Bears guard \textbf{Kyle Long} \href{https://theathletic.com/1106407/2019/07/30/letters-from-bears-camp-ha-ha-clinton-dix-returns-eddy-pineiro-gets-his-second-shot-khalil-mack-and-his-popularity/?source=rss}{is ready for 2019}:


\begin{quote}
``Last January, the seventh-year Bear was looking forward to a surgery-free offseason after everything he went through from 2016 to 2018. He’s been available throughout the offseason program and training camp after having to take 'veteran days' last summer.

``Nagy has heard Long, a three-time Pro Bowler from 2013 to 2015, is in 'the best shape, condition, strength, mental' as he’s been as a Bear.

``'Where he’s at right now is in a good place,' Nagy said. 'And so he’s worked hard for that. He’s all-in. He’s committed. Even today, he’s out there running around when we gave some other guys similar in age a vet day. And so that’s a credit to him, and we want to just make sure that he gets stronger and stronger, and then when we get to Week 1, he’s at the best he’s ever been.'''
\end{quote}

There's been a lot of talk in the offseason about Long's age and various fans, if not media members, on Twitter have suggested that at 30 years old his best days might be behind him.  Long landed on injured reserve in 2016, 2017 and 2018.

Particularly given his large personality, Long's silence since camp has started has been deafening.  It could be because he doesn't like the doubts being expressed about him.  That might not be such a bad thing.  A healthy Kyle Long with something to prove could prove formidable once the season starts.

Who do you project to be the reserve O-linemen? — @pistolpete54

Rashaad Coward has an excellent chance to nail down a spot on the 53-man roster, and it’s pretty clear Ted Larsen, who is having a nice
start to camp, will emerge as a reserve interior option. The Bears will likely keep eight offensive linemen, and that creates an interesting
battle for the eighth spot. I would say that is pretty open right now with a lot of preseason action ahead that will shape decisions.

I wonder if the younger guys will have a better chance than Larsen

\begin{quote}
``Is there any benefit, cap-wise or other, to the Bears keeping one kicker or another? — @steveoatms

``There is no way the Bears will base the decision on the kicker for this season on money or cap space. Fry and Pineiro are each signed for \$495,000 this season and would count that much
against the cap, so there is no difference in that regard. I can’t see a kicker who would become an option for them between now and the start of the season who would cost a lot. \textbf{Robbie Gould}
was never an option as the 49ers franchise-tagged him. 

``Everything I’ve read so far from camp has both kickers performing well. But if it comes down to a little more leg strength or slightly better consistency, which would the coaching
staff choose? — @chriscremer5

``In that scenario, I think the Bears would choose the kicker with better consistency. What is more important? A kicker who is money from 30 to, say, 45 yards or a kicker who has a better chance
of banging one through from 55? I think you go with the more consistent guy for the kicks that are going to come up much more often. But it’s hard to believe a final decision will come down to
issues that black and white.''
\end{quote}

There is one aspect of this kicker competition that Biggs didn't mention.  The Bears give up a seventh round pick to the Raiders if Pineiro is on the Bears roster for 5 games.  They'll happily give that up if he works out.  But it is an issue if all else is equal.

There is, however, one subtle advantage that Pineiro has.  Pineiro apparently won the job with the Raiders before going on injured reserve last season.  That means that the Raiders liked him.  That can have an effect upon the decision making process.  Somewhere in the back of the minds of general manager Ryan Pace and head coach Matt Nagy, they are probably thinking, ``Well, the Raiders liked him.  So shouldn't we like him, too.''.

That's not a major factor - these guys definitely have their own minds.  But if its close, it could be the thing that tips the scales.

How does Eddie Goldman look? I know his weight has fluctuated during camps over the years. It was great
to see him be healthy and effective all of last year. — @tomwade18

Goldman looks really good in the middle of the defense, and weight has not been an issue for him for more than two
years. With so many other “name” players on the defense, it can be easy to overlook Goldman when talking about
this defense, but he’s one of the best players on the team and an absolute force against the run. There’s no doubt in
my mind Goldman is one of the top five nose tackles in the league. Maybe top three. He’s very talented and only 25
years old.

** ON RADAR Comment on this.  I don't see them cutting him after making the position switch and I think they want to use Sowell in situaiton wher they used three OTs last season.  Having a real TE who can block like a tackle in those situaitons makes them more versatile and unpredictable.

Bradley Sowell as a tight end? What are your thoughts on how he’s doing filling that position? Should the
Bears still be shopping for a tight end? Trey Burton can’t do this all by himself. Is Ben Braunecker playing
the position well? Is that position the weakest link? — @jeggieloveskit1

Sowell has looked smoother running routes than I would have anticipated, and that’s not a knock on him. It’s not often
you see a veteran offensive lineman shed weight and line up at tight end. He’s going to be fine when it comes to the
blocking assignments they want him to handle. Does he make the final roster? That’s the question the Bears will have
to answer in the next few weeks. Burton can’t do it all by himself, and reality is Burton and Sowell are completely
different players. Burton is a smaller pass-catching tight end, and Sowell is a Y or blocking tight end. I think
Braunecker can handle a bigger role and he moves pretty well, but we have to see him do it. This isn’t the strongest
position on offense, and if you want to call it the weakest link, I guess you can. But I don’t think the tight end position
is going to drag down the offense.

----

Bradley Sowell was a serviceable backup tackle who could have gone elsewhere but stayed in Chicago to
be a tight end. Now he has little chance to get signed somewhere else if he’s cut. How likely do you think
he was promised a roster spot? — @bonedawg1978

I highly doubt the Bears promised anything to Sowell when they asked him to change positions, which officially
happened in May. Sowell did not have a chance to go elsewhere. He signed a two-year contract with the Bears on
March 12, 2018. He has a base salary of $1.45 million this season and already earned a $50,000 workout bonus.
Sowell really earned that by dropping from more than 300 pounds to 270 for the start of training camp. Let’s see how
he handles preseason action. I know Sowell is optimistic.

** ON RADAR Loser's Lament.  We will find out what the Bears are made of this year.

“It’s not like we were out of games,” Rivera said. “It’s not like we didn’t have a chance to win. It just didn’t come to
fruition. Probably the hardest pill to swallow is we had a chance to win all of those games. You can go right down the
list. If we win any of those two games, we’re in the playoffs. That’s how crazy it was. My emphasis, and hopefully the
guys understand what I am trying to get at, is ‘We were pretty good and we had our issues.’ ”

-----

Last season the Panthers started 6-2 but won one of their final eight games to finish 7-9.

-----

Those issues started with a catastrophe last summer when left tackle Matt Kalil went out with a knee injury in
preseason. The Panthers played musical chairs on the offensive line and that lasted only so long. Quarterback Cam
Newton suffered a right shoulder injury on a hit by the Steelers’ T.J. Watt and required offseason surgery.

\textbf{Brad Biggs} at the \textit{Chicago Tribune} \href{https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bears/ct-cb-bears-panthers-brad-biggs-10-thoughts-20190809-65kaonc3rvebvhidtj2cxiwgeq-story.html}{on the performance of Bears rookie running back \textbf{David Montgomery} last night}:

\begin{quote}
  ``Six touches for rookie running back David Montgomery was all that was needed to feel really good about him — and the role he’s going to play in this offense.

``Montgomery already looked the part in training camp, running hard through tackles in some rare live action in Bourbonnais. But a chance to see him go against the Panthers,
albeit a brief chance, was enough to confirm what was expected. Montgomery looked really good in the open field. He looked good in the low red zone, running to daylight after a
jump-cut at the line of scrimmage on a 7-yard touchdown. He looked natural catching the ball. If you were seeking validation that general manager Ryan Pace made the right
move in paying a pretty hefty price to trade up and select Montgomery, this was a heck of a start.''
\end{quote}

My first impression of Montgomery is similar to what my first impression of former Bears running back \textbf{Jordan Howard} was - he isn't going to be running away from guys very often. And unlike Howard, Montgomery isn't particularly big though his center of gravity is lower to the ground than I thought it was.  But, similar to what I eventually concluded about Howard, I can see why the Bears like him.  Montgomery is a football player.  And that's probably more important than superior physical talent.

Don't get my wrong.  Talent is important and you have to have at least some of it to succeed.  But you don't have to be the fastest guy on the field.  In Howard's case, his ability to find small cracks in the line and to slip through to make gains was a huge strength for a big back.  It looks to me like Montgomery has some of that vision when he bounces the ball outside.  Defenses are going to have to play the run with discipline whenever Montgomery is on the field or he's going to burn them for big gains.

You can also see where Montgomery could succeed in the passing game.  Get him into space and his quickness and ability to break tackles starts to show itself.  He's got instincts and he runs with effort.

Yeah, the guy probably is going to get caught from behind a few times this year.  But overall, I like what I see and I think Montgomery's strengths could far out weight his weaknesses.  I see a guy who could quite possibly match the production of a \textbf{Matt Forte} as a very good running back that could provide yet another aspect to what is looking like its going to be a versatile offense.

In particular, he highlighted the situation of running back \textbf{David Montgomery}:

\begin{quote}
The Bears’ exhibition loss against the Panthers Thursday night produced a healthy dilemma for coach Matt Nagy.

Do the Bears really need to see more of running back David Montgomery in the preseason?

It wouldn’t be surprising if Nagy is now leaning toward “no” after his prized rookie totaled 46 yards on six touches and scored on an impressive 7-yard touchdown run in his NFL debut.
\end{quote}

Montgomery. like most rookie running backs, has to learn to pass protect if he wants to play.  Not that he did a bad job.  But all of these guys need work on it because they did it so rarely i college.  This is why \textbf{Jordan Howard} didn't start out of the gate.  They can't just roll these guys out there and get Trubisky killed, no matter how well they run.

Montgomery will start out of the gate or at least get a lot of playing time.  That is clear.

I think that makes it all the more important that he get as much practice protecting the quarterback before then as possible.  Yes, its a risk.  But its better to risk injury to Montgomery in the preseason than to risk losing your quarterback to a rookie mistake once the season begins.

That’s a good question, and we’ll have to see how things play out over the summer. 

We’re learning his skill set,” running backs coach Charles London said. “He’s a very versatile player and we’re going to put him in as many spots as we can and give him as much as he can handle, and he’s proven he can handle a lot.”

I think you will see him a little bit everywhere, and like I said, you want the ball in his hands because he’s that dynamic-type player, but obviously you can’t release him (into the pattern) every time. He needs to be back there. He needs to understand protections and what’s going on. He’s got to be back there to protect Mitch (Trubisky) when it’s time to protect him

Hiestand wasn’t ready to offer too many evaluations of his offensive line until the pads come on. For example, Hiestand said center is “the best place” for Whitehair, and guard is the “best place” for Daniels. For both those statements, he was sure to say “right now” as a qualifier.

“The thing that you can’t do is you can’t make judgments on offensive linemen in shorts. That never works,” he said. “As soon as you think, well, let’s do it this way, then you get in there and it’s live football and it’s like, ‘Oh jeez, I just wasted a lot of time, this isn’t gonna work.’ We’re not going to force anything. James will get a lot of work at center. Cody’s had a lot of work at guard in the past so he doesn’t need much work there, so focusing him at center and letting him play there is good and let James work at left guard.” 



* [#C] https://theathletic.com/370142/2018/05/29/sophomore-star-talent-is-not-a-question-for-bears-quarterback-mitch-trubisky/ One of the biggest pluses in Trubisky’s arsenal is his ability to throw with accuracy on the move. This was something North Carolina asked Trubisky to do often, but former Bears offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains didn’t do enough of. When Loggains got Trubisky on the move, the results were typically positive. Not only did this cut the field in half and simplify Trubisky’s reads, it took advantage of a trait that separates him from many of his peers.

you cant roll him out all the time  well see more of it but he wont have arrived until he can throw with consistent accuarcy fro the pocket  Loggians and Fox challenged him to do that

In relation to point 1, Trubisky won’t be getting the benefit of the doubt his year. He has to be successful or he’s going to hear criticism he didn’t hear last year. Refer to trib interview I just sent for comments on adversity. 

Regarding 4 the veteran QBs will be important. Nagy is the only experiences coach with a record of success and he was callin g plays so that Reid could spend more time with mahommes.

* Regarding 10, it all dends upon Cohen's ability to block.  If he can do it, he'll ba an effective 3rd down back.  Otherwise he's either a gadget player or another WR on a team that already has Gabriel and Miller.

* Keep and eye on Miller's hands.  Big play offenses can make up for drops.  WIll this one be able to?

Miller’s run-after-catch won’t be as apparent in a training camp setting, but his big hands and ability to win his one-on-one matchup should be apparent if he’s as advertised. Miller is going to be high on the list of “players to watch” because of his ceiling.

Training camp practices will also provide the first examples of how Miller and Gabriel are utilized in the offense — where they line up, which routes they run, etc.

Scott Bordow at the Arizona Republic \href{https://theathletic.com/945667/2019/04/25/2019-nfl-draft-live-tracker-dane-brugler/}}reviews the pick of quarterback Kyler Murray} for The Athletic:

\begin{quote}
  Cardinals general manager Steve Keim said he didn’t want to take Kyler Murray after trading up to get Josh Rosen in the first round last year but he was won over by Murray’s talent. This is a gamble for Arizona. Few teams had Murray as the No. 1 player in the draft and it’s fair to wonder if the Cardinals would even have considered Murray if they hired anyone other than Kliff Kingsbury as coach. This will either work out spectacularly for Arizona or cost Keim and Kingsbury their jobs some day.
\end{quote}

My guess is that Bordow is right.  The Cardinals don't take Murray if anyone other than Kingsbury is the head coach.  The reason is simple.  Murray fits what the Cardinals want to do out of the box whereas any other coach outside of Seattle would have had to change thier entire offense to make Murray work.  Murray's size makes him less than suitable for an offense that relies on sitting in the pocket and finding the open reciever.

I tried to figure out wher the next likely landing place for Murray was if he got by the Cardinals.  My guess is that it would have been a long way down the list.  Murray not only landed in the perfect spot to take advantage of his talents.  He may have landed in the only spot.

* ON RADAR I think a look around the NFC North division with a focus on each team is called for.  This article does a good job with comments from The Atheltics contributors for each team.
** ON RADAR [[https://theathletic.com/1081461/2019/07/24/roundtable-can-nfc-north-rivals-bears-vikings-cash-in-on-super-bowl-aspirations/?source=rss][Roundtable: Can NFC North rivals Bears, Vikings cash in on Super Bowl aspirations? – The Athletic]]


Lions: Revealing. Lest there was any remaining mystery about where Matt Patricia is taking this roster and what he believes it takes to win in this league, the Lions tossed all the evidence out on the table. Just about every key addition on offense — T.J. Hockenson, Jesse James, Danny Amendola, new OC Darrell Bevell — points to a multidimensional, ball-control attack built to test defenses sideline to sideline more often than vertically. That plan pairs with a defense now featuring Trey Flowers and a potentially dominant D-line in front of a big, physical linebacking corps. Call it modified old-school football.
** ON RADAR [[https://theathletic.com/1081461/2019/07/24/roundtable-can-nfc-north-rivals-bears-vikings-cash-in-on-super-bowl-aspirations/?source=rss][Roundtable: Can NFC North rivals Bears, Vikings cash in on Super Bowl aspirations? – The Athletic]]


Packers: Rejuvenation. The Packers have a new voice at head coach for the first time in 13 years. Matt LaFleur steps in from the Sean McVay and Kyle Shanahan coaching tree to revitalize an inconsistent Packers offense despite having (arguably) the most talented QB in the NFL. Within the last 18 months, the Packers have now replaced the head coach, offensive coordinator, defensive coordinator and general manager — an organizational shake-up that doesn’t ripple through Green Bay very often. Thirty-five-year-old Aaron Rodgers is quietly entering the back end of his career and recovering from a knee injury that left him less than 100 percent throughout most of 2018. After saying goodbye to Jordy Nelson last summer, this offseason saw an end to the Randall Cobb era in Green Bay. Perhaps the youth movement of skill players can recharge an offense that lacked efficiency over the past few seasons.

Vikings: Stability. Entering a cap-strapped offseason, it looked for a time as if the Vikings might lose both linebacker Anthony Barr and tight end Kyle Rudolph, two mainstays and leaders on the team. Instead, Barr changed his mind on leaving in free agency and returned to Minnesota for less money than he would have gotten from the Jets, and Rudolph agreed to a new deal that lowered his 2019 cap hit. The Vikings now return 10 of 11 starters on defense and all but two linemen on offense.
