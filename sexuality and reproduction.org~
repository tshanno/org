** [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659907/][Good review of hormoal changes associated with parturition.]]   I was asked why pogesterone goes down before parturition.  It looks like it isn't completely known but part of it is tht DHEA androgen feeds into the sythesis pathway past the progesterone.  So progesterone can go down while estrogen goes up.
