*** Pre-call questions/notes
**** I assume these are cardiac myocytes?  How well was AKAP over-expressed?
***** Yes.  Don't really know - nothing to compare it to.
**** What worries me is that all of the taus in the grant are lower except the H89.  Its as if the forskolin wasn't working.
**** Do the cells respond physiologically to the forskolin?
***** She will check this.
**** What is your data acquisition rate? Can you send me a data set?
***** She talked about sending me one but I didn't re-enforce it so it may not happen.
**** Can we try photobleaching more of the cell?
***** Will try
**** What happens with PLB over-expression?  Can we do a double expression experiment?
***** Maybe for the future
**** myotubes are bigger...  Should we try those?
***** Maybe later
**** Should we talk again?
***** Yes.  Circumstances dictated 3 weeks to 1 month
**** Do you have other projects?
***** She does.  They are AKAP related and they aren't going well either but all of her eggs aren't in this basket 
** Phone call with Don Bers (530) 752-6517‬ 2018-05-22
*** Struggling
**** We weren't getting adequate temporal resolution but now measuring time to 50% decline for every transient so we think that issue is solved.
**** Cells tend to die upon rapid switch (Did Lipsius do rapid switch?)
**** Cells tend to stop contracting.
**** Not at all sure Dan has the most efiicent set up - sometimes misses cells and we get no response.
*** Wanted to talk before Friday so that a plan would be in place
*** Would suggest that Dan visit California for at least 2 weeks in July
**** Would like for him to see how you guys set this experiment up.
**** Might be helpful for you to see what's going wrong
**** Forces seperation from other lab and allows Dan to concentrate on the experiments.
*** Don agreed with this plan.  Suggested I come out for a couple days toward the end of the visit.
** AKAP Meeting
Scheduled: May 25, 2018 at 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM
*** Ken and Sabine doing ISO and epinephrine kinetics on AKAP KO.
*** Interfering peptide with FRAP 
*** Tom - FRAP experiments
*** Sabina is seeing striations with AKAP expression - I never did.
*** She will try decreasing exprssion time.
*** Sending Dan to Bers Lab in July to work with Ken.  I will join the last couple days

*** We walked through the data - I had trouble with the sound on my end so we had to FaceTime with our iPhones.
*** Suggestions
**** Try Applying an increased local Ca.
**** Include dye in the pipette to see exactly where you are hitting the cell.
**** Try the membrane pemeant form of the AKAP ihibitory peptide. 
***** Get this from Sabina
**** Try IBMX and forskolin.  These should affect global cyclic AMP and should not have a gradient.

* *Notes*
** You were having trouble with 2019-06=19-12.  You were just about to reanalyze with new parameters for 25 micron band.  Try these.
** Ideas for Dan
*** TG to inhibit phosphorylation of some of the PLB
*** Partial Ca channel block
*** Even slower stimulation rate
** The Biophysicist?

******* The x-axis appers to be messed up so I was guessing as to how many lines in I should make the first transient.  
******* Had to round the interval between beats to an integer which probably introduced a small time error that accumulated over many beats.
******* It also appears that the stimulation rate wasn't exactly 0.5 Hz.

**** 2019-06-07
***** Initial Analysis
****** The analysis of these cells indicated a possible affect on the decline to 50%.  I'm not sure , though.  The  linear nature of the decline makes me think that as the transients gradullay become more off center the time to 90% gets shorter just because the transient never gets to 90% of the pak i.e. the "time to 90%" is actually the time to the end of the segment.  Still, its always band 3 that seems to be hitting this limit.  So the decline must still be slower...

  These are all control cells where the ISO simply wasn't turned on.  So they are all just being stimulated at steady-state.  I just wanted to confirm that there aren't any relevant artifacts being added by the analysis.
***** [[message://%3c9A0A9BA1-B4AA-4CB0-B52B-1D8F6E5A7BBF@rush.edu%3E][Re: More analysis]]


I got 3-5 Control-Tyrode cells today, some better than others but it is clear that there was no increase in transients over the course of the run.  There was a shift with some either up or down a little at the start of the perfusion but no sign of any increase and in contrast for some the transient actually decreases toward the end which is not seen with the ISO cells.  So you can get the data tomorrow if possible I think that these will suit your purpose. 

Also, I'm doing a cell isolation again tomorrow and Thursday since I can not do one Friday ( Jiajie needs to use the confocal ) and will attempt to get more ISO perfused cells.

******* No surprise, this analysis confirms what we saw with the initial band analysis.  Both the time to 90% and the time to half decline is delayed further up the cell.  The increased detail in this data should help me to make better calculations.
******* The 10 μm band gives OK results for the peak - which also shows a gradient.  I felt the 25 μm band gave better results for the declines.
******* Judging from the transient peak spatial data it looks like the ISO hit about half way up the cell.  This needs to be looked at further.

  Analyzed 2019-05-31 ro 2019-06-07.  I'm concerned about the analysis.
  
  It looks to me like the "best" cells from Dan showed a difference in the time to 90% decline.  These were 2019-06-07-2 and 2019-06-07-3.  These were collected after Dan uped the ISO concentrtion to 2 uM.
  
  What is concerning is that band 3 shows a linear decline in these cells.  This might be due to a gradual drift in the analysis due to the fact that the stimulation rate wasn't exactly 0.5 Hz.  The "time to 90%" may have actually been the time to the end of the segment that I was analyzing.  This should, of course have been a window where the fill transient could be visualized.  However, it was obvious that it was cutting off part way down the transient late in the analysis at the later time points.

- The other thing that worries me is that I think we need control data to make sure that even the data that we didn't think came from "good" cells showed a decline in both time to peak and time to 90%.

- I think we should keep the ISO at 2 uM

- *I think we need control data to make sure that what I'm seeing isn't an artifact.*

  Reanalyzed 2019-06-07-2 and 2019-06-07-3.
  
  Reanalysis 1 was simply playing with the begin and end transient times to center the transients since we weren't at exactly 0.5 Hz.
  
  Reanalysis 2 was reanalysis 1 with a 9 point box car smooth.
  
  Both sets of data look better.
  
  Still no differences in either cell in the time to half max.
  
  Cell 2 seems to definitely have a slower response in band 3 than bands 1 and 2 in the time to 90% decline.  This confirms what the first analysis showed but the data look better and less like it might be artifact.
  
  Interestingly, cell 3 had no shortening at all in band 3 for time to 90% decline.  And there appears to be a real difference between bands 1 and 2 (unlike cell 2).
  
  Reanalysis 2 has all of the parameters hard coded in so I'll know exactly what I used.

  2019-06-11 was all control data with no ISO perfusion.  I did some analysis of the 2019-06-11 data but didn't finish.  The analysis of the cells up to number 10 was wrong because I wasn't using the right spatial parameters.  I'll have to redo cells 5-9.
  
  Cells 10 and 11 were done correctly and showed no decline in the time to half decline or time to 90% decline.  So I' reasonably confident that the analysis isn't adding any artifacts.
  
  2019-06-12 was all ISO data.  All bands in Cells 1,3 and 4 declined but cells 1 and 3 didn't show any apparent difference in the decline of the times to half and 90%.
  
  Only cell 4 showed the response we are looking 4.  Band 3 definitely responded late and possibly more slowly to the ISO for both the time to 50% decline and time to 90% decline.
  
  Interpretation:
  
  * The mathematical analysis isn't adding an artifact.
  
  * I'm a bit concerned about the "time to declines" that I'm getting in terms of the numbers.  Given that the whole transient should be only 2000 ms long, a time to 90% decline of 3000 seems wrong.  I'll have to take a further look at the code to see where this discrepancy is coming from.
  
  * I think Dan might be hitting too much of the cell on some of these so that the ISO effect disappears.  Given the amount of trouble he's having controlling this, I may have to do some further analysis in order to make this data quantitative.
  
  I'm thinking of keeping the 50 pixel banding but moving down the cell line by line (average of 25 pixels on each side).  I'll look at each line and determine when they hit some mark, let's say a time to 25% decline in time to 90%.  I'll determine more or less where along the length of the cell the first delay in this time seems to be and figure that's where the ISO stops hitting the cell.  From there, determining the rate at which the response propagates up the cell whouldn't be hard.

  Only analyzed cells 3 and 4.
  
  This revised analysis is a moving spatial average of the flursesence.  So, for instance, the first "band" of the 25 μm is actually centered on a line 12.5 μm from the edge with a total width of 25.  The analysis then moves 1 pixel over and repeats for the next band.  This gives filtered data over the entire length of the cell.
  
  I also generated figures which have band number on the x axis.  In this case, each line represents a transient.  My hope is that I can better localize exactly where the ISO is hitting the cell by looking at which band immediately respond to the ISO (those that are being perfused) and which are delayed and by how much (the longer the delay, the further from the region being perfused.
  
  This led to some interesting results.
  
  It looks like the ISO hit cell 4 about half way up.  This needs to be looked at further.  The cell responded well and You can definitely see a spatial gradient in the response in terms of time to half decline, time to 90% decline and transient peak.
  
  There might be something there in cell 3.  The transient peak data seems to show a gradient but its hard to tell.  This data really needs to be normalized to the intial level.

Note also that I fixed the time bug.  The times to half and 90% decline should be accurate now.

  This cell actually did respond to ISO but the transient data kind of looks like it responded in the middle and them the response diffused out to the ends.  The time to declines who a gradient only on the top end.  Note the band data where the final decrease in time to 90% takes place very lat at the very top 20% or so.  Dan hit this one really high be there might be something we can get out of it.
  
  2019-06-11-09 to 11
  These were the only control cells that I analyzed.  I'll go back and reanalyze later.  Suffice it to say that there was no apparent change due to the analysis and there do not appear to be any artifacts added on that account.
  
  2019-06-07-4
  There definitely is a gradient here in the time to 90% decline.  There's nothing there in the time to half decline.  The gradient is there in the peak transients as well.
  
  Both seem to show that the response basically stops and doesn't make it all the way up the cell.

  Note that the profile for this cell went all the way to the edge.  Used 500.
  
  There's some unsteadiness in the peak transient data over time but it looks like there's a gradient there.   When You look at the raw transient traces over time it does look like the peaks go up and down a bit.  May not be able to use this.
  
  The band Vs. tt90 data seems to show that this cell got hit about halfway up.  Definitely a gradient in this data but its very noisy.  There might be something in the tt50 but its too noisy to tease out.
  
  2019-06-07-2
  
  There might be a gradient in the tt90 data but I wouldn't bet that it will amount to anything.   Nothing in the tt50 data.
  
  The transient peak data shows a definite gradient.  The 25 um band data looks better.

  2019-06-04-1 and -2 This data's no good.  It looks like there might be a gradient in the transients but the peaks are almost random as a function of space.

  2019-06-06-05 Was pretty noisy.  The peak transient data migh tbe useful.

  Reanalyzed 2019-06-11-05, 06, 07 and 08 as on 2019-06-18 and 19.  There was, as expected, no artifacts associated with the analysis in these control cells.

  I did add a line to the script to save the workspace.  This may be a good idea as having the data saved may help with the inevitable further analysis that Will need to take place with this data.
**** 2019-06-22,23 & 24 Analysis of 2019-06-19 data
- Note taken on [2019-06-24 Mon 07:06] \\
Only analyzed Dan's "best" cells.  I'm going to have to get around to analyzing soe of the more iffy cells eventually to make sure there isn't something significnt hiding in there.

Some of This data was analyzed with 10 micron moving averages for the transient peaks but 25 micron moving averages seem to be giving the best analysis and I think I'll stick to that from now on.

This was for the most part usable data.  2019-06-19-21 was, indeed, the best and This might make a good sample cell.
  
  Generally speaking the Peak transient data is the least noisy but it often seems to go up an down and the peaks most down stream are sometime lower than the ones more toward the middle of the cell.   Its possible that Dan is hitting the cells high enough up to where the ISO is diluting out as it is washed down stream over the cell.  However Note that the transient decline data does not show This tendency towards dilution of effect down stream.
  
  The time to half decline remains unreliable but it is definitely there on occasion.  For whatever reason it doesn't appear to be as sensitive as the time to 90% decline.
  
  All of the effects tend to stop short rather than propagate all the way up the cell.
  
  1.  Could be the SR Ca pump is so cranked up that its taking up the Ca faster than it can diffuse (both inside and outside the SR).
  2.  Could be that some essential element is not diffusable.  What is the role of the cytoskeleton?  Perhaps some experiments with cytochalasion?

  2019-06-26-19 was a cultured cell.  The transients looked good but I think the peak transient data is all that's usable.
  
  Also Note that in preparations for my call with Don Bers I looked a lot more closely at the 2019-06-19 data.  It turns out that some of the bands are saturating. Care will have to be taked to cut these bands if we use the data.  I looked back at 2019-06-07-04, one of our best cells before 2019-06-19 and it didn't saturate.
  
  I asked Dan to cut back on the laser a bit.

**** 2019-06-28, 29, 30 Analysis of 2019-06-27
:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2019-06-30 Sun 14:54] \\
  Finished analysis.  Results were consistent with the findings on the 28th.  Some cells showed a response (including some that got perfused with Only 2 mM Ca) and some didn't.
- Note taken on [2019-06-28 Fri 14:53] \\
  Cells stimulated to steady-state at 0.5 Hz.  Higher Ca perfused locally through the pipette.  For cells 1-5 it was 2 mM.  For cells 6-12 it was 4 mM.  We're looking for a local change in the Ca transients where the pipette is.
  
  The 'A' cells were the same as those without 'A' except Dan re-positioned the pipette to make absolutely sure he was hitting the cell.
  
  Dan didn't think he saw an effect on any of these but I think I'm seeing something in some of them (08A and 10, in this case).  The time to 90 and 50% decline doesn't change (no surprise) but the there might be a transient gradient in those two.
  
  I'll have to analyze the rest of this data.  In the meant time I advised Dan to double the [Ca] in the pipette (4 mM to 8 mM) and in the bath (0.5 mM to 1 mM).  We'll take the bath to 2 mM if necessary.  The idea is to load up the SR a bit more so we get more response to the increased Ca current on the pipette end of the cell.

***** All of these were done with 4 mM Ca in the pipette and 1 mM Ca in the bath.  We hope to achieve increased CICR thorough increased Ca currentwhile maintaining SR Ca load.  We lowered the [Ca] in the pipette from the 8mM used on 2019-07-02 to avoid the decreased Ca transients that we saw underneath the pipette in some runs (though this was interesting and could deserve some follow up).

***** All of these were done with 4 mM Ca in the pipette and 1 mM Ca in the bath.
***** I think I have an explanation for the results where the transients are decreasing in some of the bands over time.  I think these bands are throwing DADs of increasing severity.  This is probably still due to increased SR and/org cytosolic [Ca] and therefore be part of the effect.  For now I'll analyze them like the others but keep in mind that they might be different and that I may have to separate them out in the end.
***** All figures are peak transient increases.  None of these showed an effect on transient decline.

I discovered that late in today’s data collection that the “up-close “ perfusion was set at a higher rate than in the past .  Cells 1-15.. setting was corrected for 16-17... sorry for error... may make difference

	I’ll look and see if there’s a difference.  My gut tells me that it probably won’t matter.  Maybe a it more movement artifact.

Dan Bare:
	Okay. I will be going to a CRC meeting from 10-11:30 and then to lunch out with a Dept. Group so should be in lab after 1:00 if you need me, also I have the  forskolin if we are ready to move to it.

Thomas R. Shannon:
	I’m looking a the data now.  I should be able to direct you by then.
	I don’t think I’m going to make it up there today.  I think another round of Ca experiments is called for.  I analyzed 11 so and only 3 maybe showed the effect.  I think despite my earlier assertion, the increased rate of perfusion might, indeed, have affected the data.  Even with reasonable success from the later cells, I think we’ll need more data.

Dan Bare:
	I was afraid 😟 of that ... the cells were very good yesterday
	And I should have gotten better results... will go again on Tuesday unless you change your mind for trial on forskolin Monday... thanks

***** *2019-07-11-07* :: This one starts at the downstream edge.  The transients in those edge bands look normal.  I'm inclined to believe it isn't an artifact.

***** *2019-07-11-14* :: Transients are throwing DADs but cut out the last 60 bands where this looked severe and where the transients were declining.  The non-DAD bands look like they are showing the desired effect.
