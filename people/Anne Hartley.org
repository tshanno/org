Hi Gary,

Would you be available to meet next week to talk about the Fetal Death session?  ​We need to iron out some details and we're having trouble doing that without your input.

What dates/times are good for you?

Anne

** DONE [#A] Email Kiya and Anne about what to do with hemolytic uremic syndrome.  Does this belong in renal vignettes or in AKI?

Anne,
They should get all the materials except the document with the answers.
 
Tom can post the video, PowerPoint and the cases. I do not mind them having the cases ( it is unlikely they will have gone through them) but I do want them to be told that they have to review the video and handout ( course notes) on Fluids and Electrolytes.
 
Best,
Syed

*** WAITING [#A] Upload all of the materials.  Set a time to release the answers.

*** WAITING [#A] Find the video from last year and put it up and time the release.
*** TODO [#A] Notify the students about the self-study for the pathophysiology workshop is on Entrada and that this is where the answers will be posted.

This sounds like a good idea except that I have concerns about the ability of the students to get a differential based upon the self-study that we’ve given them (or, more accurately, the lack of male information in the self-study the we’ve given them).

I’d say this would be OK if you are careful about what you do.  They’re basically gong to have to be able to figure out the answers from what is in the pathology and genetics lessons, what the clinical educators tell them as they walk them through the clinical reasoning for the male vignette above your exercise, and common sense.

For the male infertility activity, there are possible causes in several organs and several types of disease.  It would not be easy for the students to derive a broad differential diagnosis from the histopathology self-study materials for this case.  This seems like a good opportunity to get the students to formulate a differential based on a pathogenetic classification.  Examples include infection, toxic exposures, metabolic/endocrine disorders, congenital malformations, and genetic abnormalities.  They may already be thinking this way but I don't think it's been emphasized.

Comments please...

*** DONE [#A] For Fetal Death, give columns 2 and 3 and match #1

*** DONE [#A] For Fetal Death, Add note to CEs that USMLE questions are optional
***  Some general edits:

**** DONE [#A] Tom:  I still need to check the dates in the headers of all of these guides.

**** DONE [#A] We need to update the contact information for Microbiology.  Presumably this will be Nell and Paria but Paria hasn’t been officially hired.  I’ll put Nell’s info in.

**** DONE [#A] This is done.  Post AGB
Keith - Abnormal Uterine bleeding is very close.   Mark Pool still needs to find out how to create links to the virtual slides and embed them into the guide so that the students can get a good, high resolution look at them.  I believe he also still needs to embed images that are not marked up for the student guide.  Mark, can you please get this done ASAP?
**** DONE [#A] Carl - Pelvic inflammatory disease is almost done as well.  Gary still has a minor edit for the women’s health activity where he’s going to make sure the students know what they need to take away from the tables in the answers.  Gary, can you please do this ASAP?
**** DONE [#A] Keith - Infertility:  

Anne is working a little bit on the clinical reasoning.  Gary, can you please see the note from Anne under the “testing” section of the clinical reasoning and work with her on finishing this up?

We made a slight alteration to Jerry’s new path activity.  Students will now be given some of the differentials which we felt were diseases that the students haven’t had yet.  I’ve also added a note to the CEs to ask them to simply walk the students through part I of this exercise.  Jerry, are the last two images in part II supposed to be marked up in the student guide as well?  If not, we need non-marked up versions.

**** DONE Keith - Teen pregnancy:  Anne is altering the clinical reasoning.  Students will be asked to interpret the urinalysis and give next steps.

**** DONE Paola - Fetal Death is in remarkably good shape.  We didn’t think any of the exercises needed to be altered.  Anne is altering the clinical reasoning and for now the plan is to duplicate what we are planning for Teen Pregnancy.  Identify a test, ask for interpretation and identify next steps.  We didn’t settle on a test, however, and suggestions about what to do about this section are welcome.
