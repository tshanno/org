  Actually talked to Lisa.  Apparently the transition to Danesha hasn't happened yet as this was the first that she heard that she would be coordinating pre-clerkship.  But I think it will eventually fall to her.
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-07-24 Wed 08:36]

*** Where are we on self-studies?
**** Danesha says she has this in hand.  Advocate is her Only issue.  She is working with Pail Kent.
**** Advocate:  Sexual Assault and Patient Care in the Emergency room (9/15) went from a 2 hour session to a 1 hour lecture this year.  Does he need to change his self-study?
**** Advocate:  Trauma and Informed Care
***** This sounds more like a professional session
***** It has no self-study
***** Jeffrey said eh thought it might have been done last year.  I don't remember it.
**** TODO [#A] Danesha - Does EBM - Evaluating Articles on Harm Session have self-study or is it all online? ::  [[https://theebmproject.wordpress.com/small-group-01/][Small Group 01: Ginde 2009 (Harm) | the ebm project]].  Check with Najia and see if she wants to use the same self-study.  If so, maybe copy and paste.  Be sure to include the link though so they can watch the videos?
*** We are finalizing the faculty guides now.
**** AGB and PID hopefully Wednesday
**** Teen PRgnancy early next week
**** Fetal Death this Friday.
