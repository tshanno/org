Anne,
They should get all the materials except the document with the answers.
 
Tom can post the video, PowerPoint and the cases. I do not mind them having the cases ( it is unlikely they will have gone through them) but I do want them to be told that they have to review the video and handout ( course notes) on Fluids and Electrolytes.
 
Best,
Syed

*** DONE [#A] Upload all of the materials.  Set a time to release the answers.

*** DONE [#A] Find the video from last year and put it up and time the release.
*** Notify the students about the self-study for the pathophysiology workshop is on Entrada and that this is where the answers will be posted.
