  What I took away from this was that if you deal with anyone outside of the US, you have to declare it as a potential conflict of interest to Rush.  It may not ultimately be determined to be one.  In fact, probably not.  But they want it all reported and they will make the decision. 
  
  As usual, physiology had a vocal presence at the meeting.  Eduardo didn't like it and, of course, Tom DeCoursey really didn't like it.  Deri and Joesfina were there.
  
  Adam Wilson sat next to me.  Chris Ferrigno was there.  Ed Barker was there.
