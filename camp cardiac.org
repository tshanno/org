Dr. Shannon,
 
Yes we will be sending everyone a finalized schedule closer to the camp but we do have room locations and the time for you session (which I believe is finalized). I have attached it to this email. Your session is again scheduled for Monday July 29th at 11:00am-12:00pm in Rm 539 AAC.
 
If there is anything cool you could think of that would be vital to show the kids or something youâ€™d like us to grab/find for you, let us know. If not, you just your presence and amazing teaching skills would be enough ðŸ˜Š thanks again for your help.
