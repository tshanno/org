  Talked to Bob about this.  First half of the class takes the exam from 11AM-3PM.  Second half takes it from 3PM to 7PM.

M1 Students:
The Vital Fluids course has a mid-course exam, similar in length to the final exam.  This exam will be on Tuesday, November 26.  We are still finalizing the testing schedule for the day but I am writing now to let you know that half of the class is likely to be scheduled to take the exam from 3-7pm.  We are sorry for this but there is heavy use of the testing center and in order to make sure that you do not have to be here on Wednesday the 27th we felt that finishing the exam later on Tuesday was a better option.  We will follow up to let you know once the exam schedule for the day has been finalized.
 
Yours,
Bob
