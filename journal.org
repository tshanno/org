***** Abstract:  The complex membrane structure of the tubular system (t-system) in skeletal muscle fibers is open to the extra- cellular environment, which prevents measurements of H+ movement across its interface with the cytoplasm by conventional methods. Consequently, little is known about the t-system’s role in the regulation of cytoplasmic pH, which is different from extracellular pH. Here we describe a novel approach to measure H+-flux measure- ments across the t-system of fast-twitch fibers under different conditions. The approach involves loading the t-system of intact rat fast-twitch fibers with a strong pH buffer (20 mM HEPES) and pH-sensitive fluorescent probe (10 mM HPTS) before the t-system is sealed off. The pH changes in the t-system are then tracked by confocal microscopy after rapid changes in cytoplasmic ionic conditions. T-system sealing is achieved by removing the sarcolemma by microdissection (mechanical skinning), which causes the tubules to pinch off and seal tight. After this procedure, the t-system repolarizes to physiological levels and can be electrically stimulated when placed in K+-based solutions of cytosolic-like ionic composition. Using this approach, we show that the t-system of fast- twitch skeletal fibers displays amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange (NHE), which decreases markedly at alkaline cytosolic pH and has properties similar to that in mammalian cardiac myocytes. We observed mean values for NHE density and proton permeability coefficient of 339 pmol/m2 of t-system membrane and 158 μm/s, respec- tively. We conclude that the cytosolic pH in intact resting muscle can be quantitatively explained with respect to extracellular pH by assuming that these values apply to the t-system membrane and the sarcolemma.

***** "Lactic acid accumulates in many intense fatiguing regi- mens and can lead to an intracellular acidosis of approximately 0.5 pH units. There are two major lines of evidence that have been used to link this decline of intracellular pH to the contractile dysfunction in fatigue. First, studies on human muscle fatigue of rapid onset have often shown a good temporal correlation between the decline of intracellular muscle pH and the reduction of force or power production. Second, studies on skinned skeletal muscle fibres have shown that acidification reduces the isometric force by a direct effect on the isolated myofibrillar proteins."  Fabiato A, Fabiato F.

Later, we showed in the same preparation that if the duty cycle (the fraction of time the fibre is stimulated at 100 Hz) was increased, the muscles fatigued more rapidly and the acidosis was greater.5 We also found that blocking the lactate transporter with cinnamate substantially increased the magnitude of the resulting acidosis.6"

"By far, the most common question about the Dolphins after the rhetorical tank-of-no-tank (seriously?) is this: Why was Chris Grier promoted to king-of-his-world powers when his drafts seem mediocre the past three years?"

I think the answer that you;ll get from most fans is that its because Mike Tannenbaum was defacto general manager and Adam Gase had too much influence over personnel.  And they'd have a point.  But only to an extent.

I have little trouble that Tannenbaum and Gase had strong opinions about who the first and second round picks should be.  But after that, more and more it becomes scouts work.  And that's Chris Grier's domain.

So how has Grier done with those crucial mid- and late-round picks?  Hard to say.  He's only presided over 3 drafts but let's take a look.

2016:
3rd round:  Kenyan Drake
3rd round:  Leonte Carroo
6th round:  Jakeem Grant
6th round:  Jordan Lucas
7th round:  Brandon Doughty
7th round:  Thomas Duarte

This was, indeed, not great.  Drake has been a solid contributor but they needed him to develop into the main running back.  He had the opportunity last year but it seemed that no one associated with the team was beating the drum to put him in that position, reportedly due to some maturity issues.  Carroo has been waived after what was a less than productive career but Grant was a hit.  I think a good draft would have had at least a solid contributor in at least one of those last three names.

2017:
3rd round:  Cordrea Tankersly
5th round:  Isaac Asiata
5th round:  David Godchaux
6th round:  Vincent Taylor
7th round:  Isaiah Ford

Really hard to tell only two years out from this draft.  Tankersly has been a disappointment when called upon to play.  I'd call both Godchaux and Taylor hits as they would both be solid members of the rotation on the defensive line this year without the scheme change.  It wouldn't have been a good defensive line but they're still both starters.  

A lot will depend on how Asiata turns out.  At the moment, he hasn't impressed anyone in limited exposure but he'll likely get his chance to compete to start this year.  

2018:
3rd round:  Jerome Baker
4th round:  Durham Smythe
6th round:  Kalen Ballage
6th round:  Cornell Armstrong
7th round:  Quentin Poling
7th round:  Jason Sanders

Again, its still early but already pretty good.  Baker and Sanders are already solid hits and Ballage shows some signs of developing into one. It's discouraging how little the others have contributed but I think its hard to ask for more than three good hits out of six in these rounds.

My conclusion is that Hyde's characterization of Grier isn't unfair.  But I also think the fans have a point.  

To have really called those picks excellent, I would have liked to have seen just one more good hit in each of those years above.  But its fair to say that if you give Grier a free hand on those early round picks, his record in the later round should give fans some signs of hope.

Omar Kelly at the Sun-Sentinel \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-chris-grier-20190426-story.html}{criticizes the Dolphins trade for new Dolphins quarterback Josh Rosen}:

\begin{quote}
  ``[T]he Cardinals fleeced the Dolphins for a quarterback nobody else in the NFL seemingly wanted.''

  ``Despite having no other bidders for Rosen’s services, the Dolphins not only sent Arizona a second-round pick for the UCLA product. They also sweetened the deal by trading away a 2020 fifth-round pick.''
\end{quote}

That's not the whole story by a long shot.  Any fair evaluation of this trade has to include the previous exchange where the Dolphins traded back from the 48th overall pick in the second round to the 62nd.  Here's how the trade breaks down assuming, as is the common wisdom, that future picks are worth a pick in the current year minus 1 round:

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
  \hline
  Trade &Dolphins give &2019 equivalent &Dolphins get &2019 equivalent\\\hline
  Dolphins trade back with Saints from 48 overall to 62 overall &second rounder & &second rounder &\\
        &fourth rounder &&second rounder (2020) &third rounder\\
  &&sixth rounder &\\
  Dolphins trade 62 overall to Cardinals for Josh Rosen &second rounder & &Josh Rosen &\\
        &fifth rounder (2020) &sixth rounder &&\\\hline
\end{tabular}
  Add all of that up and here's what that means.  After all is said and sifted, the Dolphins got a top ten pick from 2018 and a potential starter for trading back to the third round and giving a fourth round pick.  Can anyone honestly tell me that if the Dolphins had made that trade while sitting at 48 overall that they shouldn't have taken it?

Ladies and gentlemen, that is a deal.  The Dolphins not only didn't get fleeced, they took the Cardinals to the cleaners.

  The Dolphins did the right thing here.  They waited the Cardinals out and bargained hard and got their guy.  And they did it in such a way that if Rosen doesn't work out, they can let him go and figure that they didn't lose that much.  So those who want a quarterback in 2020 aren't out anything by this deal.

  The only real question is whether one year will be enough to properly evaluate Rosen.  It certainly will take longer than that to fully develop him.  But it says here that if the Dolphins know what they're doing, they'll at least have a good idea of what they have by the time the 2020 draft rolls around.

  And from what I can tell so far, they do know what they're doing.

It caused both DeShaun Watson and reigning MVP Patrick Mahommes to fall into a range where teams that know what they're doing could trade up and get them while teams that don't know what they're doing took a pass.

It just goes to show how little the prevailing media opinion should influence fans' attitudes toward the draft.  If you are praying that the Dolphins don't take a quarterback because "all of the potential first rounders would have ranked behind all of last year's first rounders", you should remember: it's all been said before.

Scott Bordow at the Arizona Republic \href{https://theathletic.com/945667/2019/04/25/2019-nfl-draft-live-tracker-dane-brugler/}}reviews the pick of quarterback Kyler Murray} for The Athletic:

\begin{quote}
  Cardinals general manager Steve Keim said he didn’t want to take Kyler Murray after trading up to get Josh Rosen in the first round last year but he was won over by Murray’s talent. This is a gamble for Arizona. Few teams had Murray as the No. 1 player in the draft and it’s fair to wonder if the Cardinals would even have considered Murray if they hired anyone other than Kliff Kingsbury as coach. This will either work out spectacularly for Arizona or cost Keim and Kingsbury their jobs some day.
\end{quote}

My guess is that Bordow is right.  The Cardinals don't take Murray if anyone other than Kingsbury is the head coach.  The reason is simple.  Murray fits what the Cardinals want to do out of the box whereas any other coach outside of Seattle would have had to change thier entire offense to make Murray work.  Murray's size makes him less than suitable for an offense that relies on sitting in the pocket and finding the open reciever.

I tried to figure out wher the next likely landing place for Murray was if he got by the Cardinals.  My guess is that it would have been a long way down the list.  Murray not only landed in the perfect spot to take advantage of his talents.  He may have landed in the only spot.

  ``[T]he Cardinals fleeced the Dolphins for a quarterback nobody else in the NFL seemingly wanted.''

  ``Despite having no other bidders for Rosen’s services, the Dolphins not only sent Arizona a second-round pick for the UCLA product. They also sweetened the deal by trading away a 2020 fifth-round pick.''
\end{quote}

That's not the whole story by a long shot.  Any fair evaluation of this trade has to include the previous exchange where the Dolphins traded back from the 48th overall pick in the second round to the 62nd.  Here's how the trade breaks down assuming, as is the common wisdom, that future picks are worth a pick in the current year minus 1 round:

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
  \hline
  Trade &Dolphins give &2019 equivalent &Dolphins get &2019 equivalent\\\hline
  Dolphins trade back with Saints from 48 overall to 62 overall &second rounder & &second rounder &\\
        &fourth rounder &&second rounder (2020) &third rounder\\
  &&sixth rounder &\\
  Dolphins trade 62 overall to Cardinals for Josh Rosen &second rounder & &Josh Rosen &\\
        &fifth rounder (2020) &sixth rounder &&\\\hline
\end{tabular}
  Add all of that up and here's what that means.  After all is said and sifted, the Dolphins got a top ten pick from 2018 and a potential starter for trading back to the third round and giving a fourth round pick.  Can anyone honestly tell me that if the Dolphins had made that trade while sitting at 48 overall that they shouldn't have taken it?

Ladies and gentlemen, that is a deal.  The Dolphins not only didn't get fleeced, they took the Cardinals to the cleaners.

  The Dolphins did the right thing here.  They waited the Cardinals out and bargained hard and got their guy.  And they did it in such a way that if Rosen doesn't work out, they can let him go and figure that they didn't lose that much.  So those who want a quarterback in 2020 aren't out anything by this deal.

  The only real question is whether one year will be enough to properly evaluate Rosen.  It certainly will take longer than that to fully develop him.  But it says here that if the Dolphins know what they're doing, they'll at least have a good idea of what they have by the time the 2020 draft rolls around.

  And from what I can tell so far, they do know what they're doing.

One thing you never hear about in these descriptions is the back's ability to block.  That's because they are rarely asked to do it in college.  But that will be the most important factor which determines whether MOntgomery will start right out of the gate.

No one is going to put any runningback out there if they think he's going to get the quarterback killed.

\begin{quote}
In his fifth draft, general manager \textbf{Ryan Pace}:

Didn’t change. He was aggressive as usual, but this time he’s playing from strength instead of weakness — fortifying a playoff team instead of building from the ground up. Even if you consider \textbf{Khalil Mack} and \textbf{Anthony Miller} part of this draft, Pace can’t afford to strike out after that, yet he took some chances on players with big upsides. It’s risky. But with this roster, Pace isn’t playing with scared money.
\end{quote}

As I do annually, I did a mock draft with reps from the other NFL teams for a \href{https://t.co/VWwtXBGEga}{podcast}.  I was on last, as the Bears didn't have a pick until the third round.  I thought it was ironic that I was on with the Saints rep who, as usual, didn't have a pick in the first round either.

When Ryan Pace came from New Orleans one of the firs things I noticed was that the Saints were always extremely aggressive with the resources that they had available.  Pace has definitely been applying whatever he learned there.

Like most Saints fans, I think we're going to have to get used to being chronically short on draft picks and cap space.  If it means being a consistent contender, I think I can live with it.

I'm not going to go down this list and pretend I know anything about these guys becasue for the most part I don't.  But I will tell you that whne they hit the field this summer, you might want to pay attention.

The Dolphins have a lot of roster openings and a lot of holes to fill.  Some of them are gong to be filled by these signings.  

And I'll add this: if you want to evaluate Chris Grier as a GM, paying attention to how many of these undrafted free agents develop is one good way to do it.  Good teams with good front offices and coaching staffs usually find a way to develop a few of these kinds of players into good, solid starters.  And these guys are going to have more than the usual opportunity to show what they can do.

\textbf{Rich Campbell} at the \textit{Chicago Tribune} quotes Bears head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy} as \href{https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-draft-observations-david-montgomery-20190429-story.html}{he talks up newly drafted running back \textbf{David Montgomery}:

\begin{quote}
  ``'Every running back has his own strength as far as what route he can run,' Nagy said Saturday, 'whether … he’s a bigger target or he’s super fast. Some running backs you can put them (as a wide receiver with an empty backfield) and they are better on shallow crosses or better with read routes, and it’s not a vertical route or a post route where they beat you with speed. They just have a good knack at that.

``'It’s not always in an empty set. You (deploy) a guy out of the backfield, now (there are) mismatches, right? Is he against a safety or is it a linebacker? Are they playing base defense versus a guy we think we can get an advantage in the pass game? Great. Are they going to play nickel or dime and dare us to run the ball? Well, when you have guys that can play all three downs, it’s nice for the play-caller, and it’s nice for the offense.'''
\end{quote}

It's all great in theory.  But there's a legitimate question as to what kind of mismatch Montgomery will actually be out of the back field.  With a lack of straight line speed, one could argue that, even lined up in a base defense, linebackers might have little trouble keeping up with Montgomery or, for that matter, \textbf{Mike Davis}, the presumed RB2.

Certainly defensive backs will have little trouble keeping up should defenses feel that they can get away with playing nickel against the run (as they frequently do nowadays).  In that respect, the lack of a blocking tight end who can also go out for the occasional pass route could also burn the Bears badly if \textbf{Adam Shaheen} doesn't develop this off season.  Campbell comments further on teh situation:

\begin{quote}
  ``[B]ecause they didn’t draft a tight end, let’s recognize the urgency for Shaheen to play up to his draft pedigree.

``Remember, Pace drafted him 45th overall in 2017. That’s a huge investment, especially in a Division II player. For as much credit as the Bears deserve for developing their two fourth-rounders in that draft — \textbf{Eddie Jackson} and [\textbf{Tarik}] \textbf{Cohen} — Shaheen has lagged. He always was going to require seasoning for his blocking technique and route running, and missing 10 games last season was unfortunate. Now he’s a noteworthy wild card in the offense’s outlook this season.
\end{quote}

Arguably Shaheen's play will be at least as big of a factor determining whether defenses feel forced to play in one formation or another depending upon his ability to both block and run pass routes.  Right now I would say he's not a factor in that decision at all.

In any case, unless Montgomery's shiftiness and ability to break tackles actually results in big plays despite his lack of speed, the Bears could be looking at a situation where they have a couple of work horse backs who can get them yardage on the ground but where their only true mismatch out of the back field will once again be Cohen.

Dave Hyde at the Sun-Sentinel \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/dave-hyde/fl-sp-hyde10-dolphins-draft-thoughts-20190429-story.html}{gives some final thoughts on the Dolphins draft}:

\begin{quote}
  "The Dolphins trade for Josh Rosen was helped out by the awful management in Arizona. If Cardinals GM Steve Keim knew he was trading Rosen, why wait until after picking Kyler Murray? Every team was down the road to their top picks at that point. If he started trade talk a month before the draft, then perhaps the New York Giants, Washington Redskins, Dolphins and others would be involved. I was told before the draft San Diego and New England were interested, too. Instead, the Giants had decided on Daniel Jones at No. 6, Washington hoped they’d get Dwayne Haskins at No. 15 and any trade market for a top pick dried up. The Dolphins effectively got Rosen at a cheap price and for Arizona’s selections of Massachusetts receiver Andy Isabella (62nd pick) and Alabama safety Deionte Thompson underlines what a good deal this is for the Dolphins."
\end{quote}

This occurred to me as well.  

The best explanation I could come up with was that the Cardinals were worried that is they tipped their hand on Murray before the draft, they might miss out on a "Godfather offer" for the first overall pick that they might have considered.  It was, for instance, rumored that Oakland liked Murray a lot.  Had they offered say, three first round picks to move up into the first position, I assume the Cardinals would have had to consider it.

There is also the possibility that the Cardinals were in secret negotiations already with Murray's agent.  Once you commit to Murray, it gives them significant leverage.  I like this explanation less in the age of the rookie salary cap.

In any case, Hyde as a point.  At bare minimum if you don't trade Murray before the draft, you trade him as soon as possible after you make the pick before other teams know if they are going to have the opportunity to get their guy.  As it turned out, the top end of the quarterback market was softer than expected with first round talent Drew Lock falling into the second round.  That meant everybody was happy with where they ended up and the Cardinals were stuck negotiating with the Dolphins.

Hyde \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/dave-hyde/fl-sp-hyde10-dolphins-draft-thoughts-20190429-story.html}{also noted how well the Do;phins are apparently set up for the 202 NFL draft}:

\begin{quote}
The Dolphins pumped a lot of resources into the 2020 draft this offseason and now have 12 draft picks.

1 — 1st round

2 — 2nd round (theirs and New Orleans)

2 — 3rd round (theirs and Ja’Wuan James compensatory pick)

2 — 4th round (theirs and Tennessee’s from Ryan Tannehill trade)

2 — 5th round (theirs and Cam Wake compensatory pick)

2 — 6th round (theirs and Robert Quinn trade)

2 — 7th round (Kansas City from Jordan Lucas trade)
\end{quote}

I noted the optimism with which Hyde anticipated getting the compensatory picks for James and Wake.  In particular, I'm not convinced that losing James is going to bring a third round compensatory pick but let's assume that he will.

The list highlights one of the changes I think we can anticipate in the new NFL labor contract as the old deal expires in 2 years.

The compensatory pick system was set up to help ameliorate the damage done when a player leaves via free agency.  they weren't meant to completely compensate for the loss, only to make it less disastrous for a team when they lose a particularly valuable asset.  But the system has developed far beyond that now.

The compensatory picks that teams get for getting a free agent go are so valuable that teams are often motivated to game the system by purposely letting the player go and taking the pick instead.  Consider the case of James.  Does anyone think there's any chance that James would have brought a third round pick in a trade before he became a free agent?  Wold anyone have given a fifth round pick for a 37 year old Cam Wake?

The pick system is currently being used for a purpose that it was not intended for -i.e. actually rewarding a team for not signing a player in free agency.  That's something the NFLPA cannot let stand and, given the justice of their case, I have to believe that the league won't fight too hard against changing the system.

Indianapolis would be a good spot except for one thing. It’s far enough north to make weather a problem. 

When Radio City Music Hall left the draft four years ago, Chicago lobbied hard to be the new permanent home. But anyone who looked out the window at the heavy snow coming down in Saturday, the last day of the draft, had to agree that the the NFL made the right decision when they started rotating cities instead. 

Indianapolis isn't that far south of Chicago.

\begin{quote}
``He’s a really good inside-zone runner. He has a good feel, especially in the shotgun, of just how the zone moves and how things feel, which is probably why Coach [\textbf{Matt}] \textbf{Nagy} and Coach [\textbf{Mark}] \textbf{Helfrich} and those guys were really interested.

``It was funny. There were a lot of teams interested in David, but the teams that seemed to be the most interested all came from that same tree. It was the Chiefs, Bears, Eagles, the Colts. Those coaches that came from that same tree, they have a bunch of gun runs that they run really well.''
\end{quote}

It's worth noting that the Bears were likely trading up to get ahead of the Bills, who were evidently looking for a running back and selected Florida Atlantic's \textbf{Devin Singletary} with the pick after Chicago's.  So there was likely something of a consensus amongst a lot of teams that he was the next best running back on the board.  Certainly the Bears suspected that the Bills would have taken him.

This article is worth reading.  There was a lot of good information beyond the usual hype.

Omar Kelly and Dave Hyde \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/xs-and-omar/116466423-132.html}{discuss what they would need to see this year to be convinced that Josh Rosen is the quarterback of the future (at the 5:00 mark)}.

Kelly's initial answer was ``7 wins''.  :eye roll:  Hyde's more reasonable response was ``You'll know it when you see it''.

A couple things here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In fairness, Kelly immediately started to back off his ridiculous response.  Seven wins on a team with more holes than answers is absurd.  But it does show you what his attitude towards this situation is.  Despite \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-kelly-column-20190430-story.html}{claiming otherwise}, he's determined not to like the Rosen experiment.

  I'm not saying that I mind that.  Like every reporter, no matter who he is, Kelly is welcome to his opinion.  No reporters, no matter how hard they try, can completely suppress those opinions when they write their articles.  And Kelly isn't just acting as a beat reporter.  He's also a columnist where he is actually paid to express that opinion (whether beat reporters should also be allowed to be columnists is a topic for another day).

  Nevertheless, this is something that needs to be born in mind when you read his articles.  They're going to be biased and an informed reader is going to have to compensate mentally for that.
  
\item Neither of these guys is right.  The truth is, with the Dolphins roster constructed the way it is, no one on the outside is really going to know whether Rosen is the answer.  It's not going to be a good year.  Peyton Manning won 1 game his rookie season.  I think we can all agree he wasn't a bad quarterback.

  What people not directly associated with the team are going to have to do is have faith that the coaches know what they're dong and that they'll be able to properly evaluate Rosen from the inside.  They're the ones in the locker room.  They're watching the film.  They'll know how Rosen responds to coaching.  They'll know his strengths and weaknesses to some extent independent of the talent around him.

  We'll be convinced that Rosen is the answer when we find out whether the Dolphins take a quarterback high in the 2020 draft.  Until then, keeping an open mind is really all you can do.

  ``The Bears are planning to sign 19 undrafted free agents. As you and others have documented, this has become an important part of the draft process as teams scramble and bid against one another to sign highly regarded prospects who slipped through the cracks. The draft was cut down to seven rounds in 1994. Do you think the NFL would consider adding more rounds given the importance of these undrafted players? — Tom S., Chicago

``No. Adding an eighth round would only force teams to have to pay players more. Good teams do well with undrafted free agents (UDFAs) and bad teams struggle to find players who can stick. Plus, isn’t the final day of the draft long enough?''
\end{quote}

Yes, if you are a reporter.  Maybe not if you are a general manager.

I actually didn't think this was a bad question (no surprise given that it was mine).  Wisconsin guard Beau Benzschawel \href{https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1122584978724982784}{had offers from 20 teams} before signing with the Lions.  It's very evident that teams are leaving good players on the board at the end of seven rounds.

But 32 teams passed on Raymond in the draft. The Bears still have an investment of a draft pick, money and maybe most importantly time in Shaheen. They’re not cutting the cord on him now.''
\end{quote}

One of the bigger surprises of the Bears draft has to be that they didn't draft a tight end from what looked like a deep class in the middle rounds.  The Bears have evidently decided to roll with Shaheen.  Raymond will evidently compete to back him up with an unsigned free agent.

Despite Nagy's comments, that second, inline tight end position has to be an area of mild concern.  Setting aside the fact that he can't stay healthy, Shaheen hasn't shown anything but potential, yet.

\textbf{Gregg Rosenthal} at \textit{NFL.com} \href{https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-around-the-league-podcast/id680904259}{comments upon the Bears} during their ``Around the NFL'' podcast (episode title: ``Around the NFC'', at the 24:45 mark).

Rosenthal mentions his distrust of teams that stand pat after a successful season and expect that roster to come back and perform at the same level (at the 24:45 mark).  Not that the Bears had much choice, as he acknowledges.

I share Rosenthal's mistrust.  This didn't work in 2007 with the Bears coming off of a Super Bowl appearance and it probably won't work this year, at least for the defense.  As was the case in 2006, the Bears were among the healthiest teams in the league last year, something that is unlikely to happen a second time in a row.  They also lost most of the defensive coaching staff.

But the reasons for this wariness go deeper than that.  Last year with a new head coach the players were less comfortable and likely for the most part concentrated harder on what was going on.  This year with the stink of success on them, at least a certain percentage of the players are likely to be more relaxed.  This can lead to a drop in performance.

In fairness, unlike 2007, the Bears have reason to believe that their offense will be better in a second year in head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy}'s system.  This is their best hope to maintain excellence in the coming season.

Armando Salguero \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article229939589.html}{separates spin vs. fact about the Dolphins draft}:

\begin{quote}
  ``Narrative: The Dolphins trade down in the second round was part of Miami’s plan to land Rosen.

``Mando verdict: Not only is this spin, it is demonstrably untrue.

``We understand that from general manager Chris Grier himself. From the Dolphins’ news conference at the end of the draft Saturday:

``Question: Were there discussions at pick 48? Did you have to trade back from 48 to make that [Rosen] trade happen in your mind, to make the numbers add up?

``Answer: 'No. The Cardinals were steadfast in what they wanted for it and they were pretty up front with all of the teams. We hadn’t really talked to them until right at the start of the draft, and I think that’s when they started contacting everyone that might be involved. As we went through, we had talked throughout the day a little bit here and there and we finally got to a point where we were comfortable in making a pick. In terms of picking up, for us, it was huge to get the second-round pick in 2020, with the Saints when we made that trade. Regardless of what was there, we were going to make that trade to get the second-round pick. We went into the draft trying to find either another first or second-round pick in 2020.'

``In one-on-one phone interviews served up by the Dolphins media relations department for a couple of national writers, Grier told both Monday Morning quarterback and Football Morning in America that the two were not connected. And he told FMIA that reports of a deal with Arizona being done earlier that somehow guaranteed a trade for Rosen after Miami traded down were wrong.''
\end{quote}

Salguero makes a lot of good points in this article but that one falls flat.

Salguearo's point is that the Dolphins made the trade not knowing if they could swing a deal for Rosen with the 62nd overall pick or not.  No deal was in place.  I have absolutely no trouble believing that.

At the same time, Salguero, perhaps purposely, misses the point.  The fact that the Dolphins felt good making the trade even if Rosen didn't come with it doesn't mean that they didn't have a potential Rosen deal in mind when they made it.  In fact, given that they were already in discussions and thought the 48th pick was too high but obviously felt the 62nd wouldn't be, it would be foolish not to assume that they didn't.

Whether the Dolphins were willing to stand on this trade without a Rosen deal or not, the end result is the same.  They basically \href{https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/miami-dolphins-post-draft-points-of-view}{traded back into the third round and added a fourth round pick to make this happen}.  Intent aside, that was the end result of their maneuvering and that is the bottom line.

Any other conclusion is just spin.

Meeting Minutes 5/3/2019

Discussion on the overall structure of a chapter
The chapter should read much like a case whenever possible beginning with a brief HPI that includes pertinent positives and negatives including a mini physical exam that only contains the relevant findings. 
Differential Diagnosis Table: Following the HPI there will be a Complaint based differential diagnosis table that is organized according to priority based on semantic qualifiers. EBM may be useful here in discussing your priority ranking of differential. 
Testing: The next section will begin with which tests to order and brief overview of why you order them then moving into what the test tells you about the disease from a foundational science perspective (including path, immuno, micro, EBM, and physio). 
Test Results: Give most likely test results - explain them in the context of pathophysiology and foundational science as related to the condition. Mini summary and treatment, explain the pharm.
FOLLOW-UP Visit: Each case is complex, so the patient will return with a new/worsening complaint that then will explore a different path. The chapter format essentially starts over with a DDx table, testing, results, and treatment with foundaitonal science woven in. This is also where call out boxes for “switcher-roo” may come in. 
At the end of the chapter, once all follow-ups are finished a clinical summary should be given as well as a summary of the foundational sciences. 

2. Resources:
   We may want to check out Critical Questions: Symptom to Diagnosis  by Scott Stern as a resource in writing chapters. 

3. Next Steps:
   Paola: Diabetes Case
Brett: MI case
Anne and Keith: Batch the case list and identify areas to integrate diagnoses, EBM, and medical ethics in order to eliminate redundancies. 
Maureen: Create Refworks for resource list and template, add content on RF criteria and immune to the MI case as well as vegatitve growth. 
Tom: begin adding physio content in cases

\begin{quote}
Q: ``Gotta build up that friendship with \textbf{James} [\textbf{Danels}] now.''

A: ``Ha, yeah, got to. James knows. I’m talking to James even more. He’s like, 'Why is Mitch talking to me all the time?' I was like, 'You’re my center now, bro, let’s do it.'''
\end{quote}

The Bears haven't announced it, yet, but this apparently let's the catch out of the bag.  I gather from this that \textbf{Cody Whitehair} is switching positions with Daniels with Whitehair moving to left guard.

It's a risky switch.  Daniels will undoubtedly be better at center but Whitehair was a Pro Bowl caliber center who was still getting better.  Whether the unit overall is be better with this switch will be one of the more interesting questions early in the season.

\textbf{Mark Potash} at the \textit{Chicago Sun-Times} \href{https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/first-and-10-bears-could-hit-the-jackpot-with-motivated-wr-emanuel-hall/}{quotes new Bears wide receiver \textbf{Emanuel Hall}} on his motivation after being passed over in the NFL draft.  Hall was expected to go as high as the second round:

\begin{quote}
  ``'I promise you it’s a feeling that I’ll never forget. That was one of the worst feelings ever, being undrafted,' Hall said at Bears rookie mini-camp Saturday. 'It felt like the longest three days of my life. I had a draft party on the second day and the third day you’re just shaking everybody’s hand, ‘Thanks for coming.’ — no one wants to do that.'''
  
``Hall’s speed (4.39 in the 40) and big-play ability made him an intriguing prospect in the draft. He averaged 23.5 yards per catch in his final two years at Missouri (70 receptions, 1,645 yards, 14 touchdowns in 22 games), with nine receptions of 50 yards or more.

``But a history of minor injuries that kept him out of four games last season and prevented him from playing in the Senior Bowl played a part in getting overlooked in the draft.''
\end{quote}

Hall fell out of the draft due to concerns about his football character.  Specifically, coaches at the University of Missouri were very up front about Hall's inability to play through those minor injuries that Potash mentions.  In fact, Hall missed the last day of rookie minicamp with an injury.  \textbf{Kenvin Fishbain} at \textit{The Athletic} elaborates:

\begin{quote}
  ``Hall battled hamstring issues and a groin injury last season, but instead of shutting it down, returned to finish off the season and play in the bowl game. Even though he got back on the field, the injury required maintenance in the winter, preventing him from playing in the Senior Bowl, and it almost kept him from performing at the combine.

  ``Doctors in Indianapolis told Hall not to participate in drills because of a possible sports hernia. Hall signed a waiver so he could run and jump, and while not at 100 percent, he ran a 4.39 40 and had the best broad jump recorded for a wide receiver at the combine (11 feet, nine inches).''

  ``Nagy discussed, though, how the Bears are confident in their staff to help with players who may have had durability issues in college.
  
``'There’s some elements to that in regards to our training program is going to be different than every other training program from other teams that they come from,' he said. 'We feel really good about \textbf{Andre Tucker} and what he does and our staff that he has, our strength staff, \textbf{Jenn (Gibson)} our sports dietician. And so we feel really good about when we bring people in here, we really sometimes don’t care as much about what happened in the past — what can we do now? Let’s fix it, let’s give him a clean slate and let’s roll.”
\end{quote}

Speed and ability aren't enough.  Apparently Hall is going to have to toughen up.  Otherwise he'll be just another track star that didn't make it.

The Sun-Sentinel does \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/sfl-star-nfl-qbs-whose-first-years-have-been-inferior-to-the-rest-of-their-careers-20190503-photogallery.html}{a photo gallery} of quarterbacks who, similar to new Dolphins quarterback Josh Rosen, had slow starts to their careers.  In one photo they highlighted the start of Peyton Manning's career:

\begin{quote}
  ``His first game was against the visiting Dolphins who grabbed three of his passes, including one for a pick-six by Terrell Buckley in a 24-15 Miami win. By the time the Colts had finished the first quarter of the season, Manning had piled up 11 pickoffs against only three touchdown passes. Things stabilized from there as he threw 23 touchdowns and 17 interceptions in the final 12 games. The rest is Hall of Fame history.''
\end{quote}

I hate clicking through these photo galleries and I usually don't bother with them.  But I knew I was going to have to read this one because I knew Manning would come up on a list of very good quarterbacks.  With all due respect to Tom Brady, Dan Marino and the many others you could mention, Manning is in my opinion the greatest quarterback in the history of the game.  I love all of those other guys but not one of them had to literally lift their team and carry them the way Manning did.

But that's not my point.  My point is that Manning elevated his game from his first \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Indianapolis_Colts_season}{3 win season} through to NFL history with the help of very good coaching from legendary offensive coordinator Jim Moore and quarterbacks coach Bruce Arians.  And Rosen is going to need that kind of help.

Like Manning, Rosen is smart.  In fact, \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/dave-hyde-blog/fl-sp-hyde5-jimmy-johnson-rosen-20190503-story.html}{in the words of former Dolphins head coach Jimmy Johnson}, probably too smart.

What did Johnson mean?

Rosen has a reputation for being arrogant.  Most Dolphins fans can't figure out where that reputation came from because \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-hyde-dolphins-rosen-20190429-story.html}{his introduction to the Miami media, as least, was nothing but positive}.  But I have an idea how Rosen might have gotten stuck with this label.

In my day job when I'm not bloviating about the NFL, I teach first year medical students.  Specifically, I deal with a lot of extremely intelligent, high achieving students that I greatly respect.  And those students challenge me by with a lot of questions.  In fact, even after doing this for going on 17 years, I'm constantly amazed at my students' ability to come up with things I've never heard before.

Sometimes these interactions test my limit when trying to show that I know what I'm talking about.  And, at least as important, they test my willingness to admit when I don't know what I'm talking about.  I enjoy these conversations, especially when the latter is true, because it forces me to learn something.  I'm nearly always better for having talked to a smart student about a topic.

But I have tell you honestly that not all of my colleagues feel the same.  There are some who believe that its their job to always show students that they are superior and they don't like interactions with students who, frankly, might be smarter, if less knowledgeable, than they are.  In the end, they explain their shortcomings to themselves by blaming the students.  Most feel that these students lack respect.

And that brings us back to Josh Rosen, who is by all accounts an extremely intelligent player.  And, let's be honest, his teachers haven't been the best.

After having had three offensive coordinators in college at UCLA, Rosen is going on his third offensive coordinator as he joins the Dolphins this season after only one year with the Cardinals.  Up until this point, \href{http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/288438/the-good-and-bad-of-josh-rosens-five-offensive-coordinators-in-four-years}{Rosen has had to deal with a carnival of coaches} including Mike McCoy, who was fired after week 7 last year, followed by Byron Leftwich, who was fired after the season.  

Someone with more cruelty in his blood than I have than me might have called it a "clown car".  

Nothing against the Cardinals staff but you don't go through coaches like that if you are good at what you are doing.

Bottom line, it would be no surprise to find that Rosen was smarter than his teachers.  And it would be no surprise to find that his teachers didn't react well to the situation.

So far it seems that Rosen has had the same benefits that Manning had in his first seasons with the Colts.  Let's hope that he finds a better home in South Florida with good instructors that he can respect and, just as important, who can respect him.

******* Vital Fluids and Vital Gases

******** Strategies
********* These blocks are very heavy in physiology, pathophysiology and and pathology.
********* Physiology:  The key is to study the old exam questions which will be distributed before each assessment.  These are actual questions that we have used in the past.  We do not test on trivia.  There are only so many topics you can ask about and there are only so many ways to ask about them.  Going through these questions can be worthwile.
********* When studying old exam questions, do not simply look at the correct anser and move on.  If you missed the question, review the material associated with ti to make sure you thoroughly understand it.
********* Use the physiology notes.  They are meant to be complete.  Even if you choose to watch the videos (the content is the same) use the notes for reference and to look up answers.  Use the recommended textbooks only if you are having trouble or are seeking a deeper understanding of the material.
********* Pathophysiology and Pathology:  Half of the battle is trying to make the diagnosis based upon the stem.  As you study, look for unique characteristics for each disease that will distinguish it from the others.  Make note of these.  Consider writing your own stems for each one.
********* Pathology:  Look for unique terms used to describe specific diseases.  For instance, the liver of a patient with congestive heart failure isn't just a light brown.  Its "nutmeg colored".  Pathologists are very good at soming up with these unique terms and they use them both on our exams and on Step 1.
********* Use the objectives.  Thoguh I wouldn't rerecommend it unless you have time, some students actually write out answers to these while studying for assessments.
********* Consider studying in groups.  This can be particularly helpful as you approach exam time when you have already gone through the material once.
********* Find a distraction-free environment to study in.  Though its less comfortable, sometimes studying at Rush rather than at home can help you concentrate.
********* Write your questions down and don't wait to ask them.  If you don't understand something, stop the instructor either during or after class and get your question answered.  Time is unlikely to answer it for you and the answer will be more clear while the class discussion is still in your head.  Some instructors come to class early to answer questions from the self-study.  Take advantage of this time.
********* Seek help early.  Take advatage of office hours and otherwise meet with your insructors frequently if necessary.  We are here to help.  In fact, its our job to help.  There are few things worse than seeing a student who didn't do well and didn't take advantage of an instructor's willingness to help.
******** Resources (I don't have as much to say here)
********* The physiology textbook is very good for the cardiovascular material in RMD 574.  This book is available online through the library.
********* Vander's Renal Physiology is helpful for furthering your understanding of the renal material in RMD 575 if you are having trouble.
********* Some students who have had physiology trouble in RMD 575 have found Respiratory Physiology:  The Essentails by John B. West to be helpful.
********* The pathophysiology text, Pathophysiology of Disease:  An Introduction to Clinical Medicine is also particularly good for both of these courses.
********* Pathoma does a good job with the pathology in both of these courses and can be particularly useful.

\textbf{Brad Biggs} at the \textit{Chicago Tribune} \href{https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-mailbag-receivers-kicker-competition-20190508-story.html}{answers your questions}:

\begin{quote}
  ``Do you see the Bears signing any veteran pass rushers now that it won’t impact their comp picks? If yes, who? — @mellothunder

``This has been a consistent question throughout the offseason, even after the team re-signed veteran outside linebacker \textbf{Aaron Lynch}, and I’m a little puzzled why. The Bears tied for third in the league with 50 sacks last season. Only three of those 50 sacks were by players no longer on the team: Nickel cornerback \textbf{Bryce Callahan} had two and strong safety \textbf{Adrian Amos} had one. With \textbf{Khalil Mack} being paid as one of the top edge rushers in the game and with investments elsewhere when it comes to rushing the passer, I think the Bears are OK here. I can’t see them spending a lot of money for another player to add to the mix.''
\end{quote}

I think I understand why.  On some level fans probably recognize that the Bears depth is likely to be challenged more this year and they are worried about it with only Mack, \textbf{Leonard Floyd} and Lynch as reliable pass rushers.

Personally I'm not as worried about ti for two reasons.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Not many teams have good starting pass rushers, let alone depth at th position.  Good pass rushers don't grow on trees and anyone who is any good was signed to a roster a long time ago, compensatory formula or not.
\item I like \textbf{Kylie Fits} and \textbf{Isaiah Irving} a lot more than most people and think one or both could step up and do a decent job if called upon.
\end{enumerate}

It will be interesting to see how the depth at the position plays out this year.

\href{https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-mailbag-receivers-kicker-competition-20190508-story.html}{Another good question} for Biggs:

\begin{quote}
``Should the Bears pursue \textbf{Ndamukong Suh}? I think that would be a great addition. — @chiwest773

Teams can now sign free agents such as Suh without that transaction affecting the formula for compensatory draft picks, so we could begin to see some movement for some of the name players who remain on the street. Suh is in that category, as is offensive tackle \textbf{Jared Veldheer}, who is reported to be signing with the Patriots. I don’t believe the Bears are planning to spend big money on any players not on the roster. It’s possible offensive lineman \textbf{Cody Whitehair}, who’s eligible for a contract extension, is the only player who will get a significant payday between now and the end of the season.
\end{quote}

Suh would actually be a good fit for the Bears strictly in terms of what he can still do on the field.  At this point in his career he can still be a big, two gapping defensive lineman who will stop the run while giving a little bit of pass rush.  But he's nowhere near the player he was earlier in his career the last time Bears fans saw him on a regular basis with the Lions.  Suh is 32 years old and the Bears have trended towards younger free agents since general manager \textbf{Ryan Pace} joined the organization.  He's also not a great culture fit.

Whether Suh signs with the Bears or anyone else will come down to money.  My guess is that no one is going to make him a big money offer at this point.  As Biggs points out, the Bears almost certainly won't.  A lot will depend on whether Suh still wants to play the game for considerably less than he's used to making.

\href{https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-mailbag-receivers-kicker-competition-20190508-story.html}{Yet another question} for Biggs:

\begin{quote}
Is \textbf{Brad Childress} under contract for the full season or just the preseason like last year? What role will he play with the offense? — @_d_r_r_

The Bears hired Childress as a senior offensive assistant, and he will be around for the entire season. He was hired as a consultant last year, working with Matt Nagy from the start of his tenure and through most of the preseason. He’ll be available as a sounding board for Nagy and will have input across the board on offense. Nagy is big on taking input from all of his coaches, and Childress will be part of that mix.
\end{quote}

If you look back at the history of this blog, you'll find that I had some rough things to say about Childress as a head coach for the Vikings.  But I like him in this role.  He's from Chicago and at this point in his career he probably wants to be here.  He's experienced in a way that Nagy isn't and there's very little doubt in my mind that he'll say what he thinks at times when maybe other assistants will hold back a little.  

But there's one other under looked factor here that could be of great benefit to Nagy and the Bears.  Childress has traditionally been a ``run first'' offensive coach.  He knows how to run the ball and that knowledge could be handy on a team where Nagy has constantly said that the running game has to get better.  Childress could help contribute to a big improvement in that area.

\begin{quote}
Reading about all the early draftee signings, I remember a time when \textbf{Cliff Stein} was first to get the Bears draft class under contract. Lately it seems they’ve been bringing up the rear. What happened? — Greg M.

What’s the race? The NFL has slotted the bonus money and salaries for draft picks. There’s no advantage to completing this right away. I have no doubt the Bears will have all five draft picks under contract before training camp begins.
\end{quote}

I'm pretty sure the agent was mostly to blame for the Bears troubles signing first round pick \textbf{Roquon Smith} last year.  Nevertheless, one does wonder if the Bears could have settled the issues with him sooner had they been further along with negotiations when camp started.

Biggs asks ``What's the race?'' and that's fair.  But my question is, ``Why wait?''.  Get the rookies under contract so that they can workout without fear of injury.

In any case, with their first pick coming in the third round, I doubt the Bears will have a great deal of trouble signing their picks before camp this year.

Omar Kelly at the Sun-Sentinel href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-sidebar-20190509-gpapecygtve4vnitzeveudpkne-story.html}{describes the defensive scheme} that the Dolphins plan to run:

\begin{quote}
``Miami’s coaches intend to run a hybrid scheme that incorporates both elements of a 4-3 and 3-4 front, and envision themselves playing with five defensive backs on the field at the same time, possibly as the team’s base defense.

``Charles Harris, the team’s 2017 first-round pick, doesn’t have a clear cut position. Is he a defensive end or a linebacker?

``Minkah Fitzpatrick, Miami’s 2018 first-round pick, doesn’t have a defined role. Will he be playing free safety, nickel cornerback, a cornerback on the boundary, or all of the above?''
\end{quote}

I think Kelly describes the forest well but he misses the point when it comes to the trees.  The players in this defense will be expected to do a lot of things but to say that they don't have ``a defined role'' really isn't true.  In fact, if the coaches do their jobs right, their role will be very clear cut and well-defined in any given situation.  That won't be - or at least it shouldn't be - the problem.

The problem comes in when you consider the talent of your players and whether they are capable of executing those well-defined roles.  In this case, new Dolphins defensive line coach Marion Hobby seems to understand the challenge.

  ``That’s where the awareness comes in,'' Hobby said.

  ``A coach used to always tell me if you trick the [defensive] ends and trick the free safety, you’re going to get a big play.  So those guys have to have some awareness to them. They have to play with their eyes and their feet. It’s hard. There are very few that can.''

  When you are playing a multiple 3-4, 4-3 scheme, to a certain extent you throw the old position definitions away.  But position definitions are still there.  They're just new.  The trick, just as it is in the old standard systems, is the same.  Getting guys who are capable of doing their jobs and getting them to the point where they can execute them is still the key to successful football.

Armando Salguero at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article230246299.html}{stumps for a Laremy Tunsil contract extension}:

\begin{quote}
``Look, Tunsil has not fully arrived. He’s not fully developed. There’s much room for growth. But no one in the Dolphins organization questions whether he should be part of the organization going forward. Because he’s very good.

``So, I’m told, there are plans to get Tunsil locked up long term also -- perhaps before the start of the regular season.''

``Paying now will ultimately be cheaper than paying later. Trust me, player salaries rarely go down. So signing Tunsil to an extension would be beneficial for 2020 and ‘21 cap purposes.''
\end{quote}

Salguero has a point.  But there are drawbacks.

As Salguero points out, the Dolphins don’t have to do this. Tunsil is under contract for 2019 and they have already picked up the fifth-year option for 2020.  If they had to, they could apply the franchise tag in 2021.

Interestingly, Omar Kelly at the Sun-Sentinel \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-xavien-howard-20190510-nmebckxrcnfnpfp2pamje77aeu-story.html}{asserts out in another article} that the Dolphins have been criticized for trying to do contract extensions too late.  He points to losses like defensive end Olivier Vernon, tight end Charles Clay, receiver Jarvis Landry, tailback Lamar Miller and offensive tackle Ja’Wuan James under Mike Tanenbaum.  I disagree with this assessment.  In each of these cases it wasn't a question of approching the player too late.  It was a quesiton of money and value where, right or wrong, the Dolphins in each case decided that there wasn't a match.

In fact, I would argue the opposite.  The Dolphins got themselves in some trouble after Adam Gase's first year by handing out a lot of contracts such as those for Andre Branch, Rashad Jones, and Kiko Alonzo that they'd probably like to get out from under.  In many cases, these players were extended when the Dolphins really didn't have to do it and they eventually let the team down either through disappointing play (debatably Alonzo), a lack of development (Branch) or poor football character (Jones).

Bottom line, a lot of money was spent that didn't have to be and probably wouldn't have been had the teams waited.

There are also some additional factors.  Players who get early long term deals tend to get comfortable.  This can lead to less concentration and a decline in quality of play.

And there is the fact that this sort of thing leads to the expectation on the part of other players that their contracts will be extended early, too.  So even if you aren't worried about extending Tunsil, the next guy who is more borderline will press for an early extension.  And when he doesn't get it, it can lead to an early hold out, one which agents have reason to expect might work simply because the team has a history of giving early extensions.

On balance, I'd say its better to wait until the 2020 offseason to extend Tunsil.  It would prevent Tunsil from having to enter a final, lame duck year and keep him out of the free agent market.  This while keeping the team from having to tag him and while setting a better pattern for other players under the new regime.  In the meantime, even if you are reasonably sure Tunsil is a part of your future, it gives you another year to make sure Tunsil remains healthy and to see how he develops and performs under the new coaching staff.

\href{What if Ryan Fitzpatrick wins the https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/its-okay-to-change-your-mind-about-dolphins-qb-josh-rosen}{quarterback competition over Josh Rosen?}

"If he wins the competition, absolutely \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-qb-competition-20190510-dj3du7vsznaddn36ju64poo73m-story.html}{I’m good with that}. I think that would be what’s best for the team and best for the Miami Dolphins," Dolphins coach Brian Flores said.

Right.

This is, of course, what Flores has to say.  But this competition is - or had better be - slanted towards finding out what the young, potential franchise quarterback can do.  

It's absolutely true that you can't just trot Rosen out there no mattter what he does.  For one thing, evaluating Rosen isn't the coaching staff's only job.  Every young player on the team has to be examined and a determination has to be made about their future with the franchise.  That's particularly true of Kenyan Drake and Jakeem Grant, \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-xavien-howard-20190510-nmebckxrcnfnpfp2pamje77aeu-story.html}{both of whom are entering contract years}.

How can you evaluate your talent if the quarterback if the quarterback can't throw the ball accurately or run the offense?  How can you develop younger players?

So you do have to have a competant quarterback in order to develp and run the team properly in a rebuiding year.  But having said that if Fitzpatrick wins this job it will mean very bad things for Rosen.  And it will mean the decision about what to do come draft time in 2020 will have already been made.

Safid Deen at the Sun-Sentinel reports that the Dolphins \href{Safid Dee}{are giving running back Mark Walton an try out}.

I found this move to be ironic given that on the very same day Flores \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-xavien-howard-20190510-nmebckxrcnfnpfp2pamje77aeu-story.html}{characterized the extension of Xavien Howard's contract as a move meant to build team culture}.

Walton was cut by the Cincinnati Bengals last month after his third arrest.  He is facing felony charges for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon, marijuana possession and reckless driving. Significantly, the March 12 incident took place in Miami, his home town.  Now the Dolphins are not only giving him a second chance, they've brought him back to a city where old friends and bad influences could exacerbate the problem.

But that's not my point.  The problem is that they've brought him into a young locker room where veteran influence will have more than the usual impact on the development of the team.

I don't have a problem with Walton getting a second chance.  But giving it to him with the Dolphins seems like a very questionable move.

Omar Kelly at the Sun-Sentinel \href{points out that the Dolphins are deficient on the ends}{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-kelly-column-20190512-ud6r7pf2rjge5n54snql6or6z4-story.html} in the new defensvie scheme.

\begin{quote}
  ``I get it. Rome wasn’t built in a day. And neither were the Patriots. But this is simple roster management issue that could be fixed with a veteran addition, similar to how Jordan Mills’ signing potentially patches up the vacant right tackle spot.''
\end{quote}

Kelly is primarily concerned with the run defense but the problem will crop up when it comes to the pass rush as well.  The Dolphins are deficient at this position, the outside linebacker when they are in the base 3-4 and the defensive end in the nickel.  This position sets the edge against the run and pushes the passer.

There's no doubt about it.  The Dolphins have a huge roster hole at this spot.  But I'd love to know who Kelly thinks the team should sign as a ``simple roster addition''.  The truth is most teams are deficient in this area.  Anyone who is any good was taken off the market a long time ago.  Even if the DOlphins were willing to part with 2020 draft picks, most of those players aren't available via trade.

The Dolphins have evidently made the decision to let this position slide in a rebuilding year.  I don't like it, Kelly doesn't like it and you probably don't like it, either.  But I think its something everyone is going to have to live with because it's not a problem that will be solved until the next offseason now.

Adam Beasley at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins/article230302419.html}{thinks he understands} the Dolphins strategy in building the offensive line. 

\begin{quote}
``[Michael] Deiter checks all those boxes.

``Wisconsin’s do-everything offensive lineman started a ridiculous 54 straight games in college.

``And the Badgers are no finesse team.

``Wisconsin averaged 43.9 rushing attempts in 2018, compared to just 23.4 passing attempts.

``So while there were more talented options available to the Dolphins before taking Deiter in the third round two weeks back, there might not have been a better option.

``We’re going to be a tough, physical team,' [Dolphins head coach] Brian Flores said during rookie minicamp.

``The Dolphins drafted like it.''
\end{quote}

I think Beasley is right.  But I have a better explanation.

The Dolpins drafted Christian Wilkins, a defensive tackle, and Dieter, a guard, with thieir first two picks.  They are planning on being strong up the middle and building outward.  And that's a sound strategy.  Nothing disrupts the oppsing offense more than pressure up the middle.  Offensive guard is being recognized as an increasingly important position in the modern NFL as teams struggle to keep the pocket clean in front of the quarterback so that he can step up and throw.

\begin{quote}
Wiederer: Do you see any limitations in his game or areas he’s going to have to either really work on or work around to be reliable at the NFL level?

Kiffin:  Pass protection. With the bigger players on that level, that’ll be more of a challenge. And being the backup here, it’s not like he got a million reps on film of that. So that’s going to be something he’ll have to work at if they’re going to want to use him on third down especially.
\end{quote}

No surprise there.  No team will put a running back out on the field who is going to get the quarterback killed.  Kiffin, a former head coach of the Oakland Raiders, would know that as well as anyone.  And most good college running backs haven't been asked to do it much. 

The good news is that Kiffin thinks Whyte is a really good pass receiver.  But the bet here is that if Whyte sees the field much for the Bears his rookie year, it will be as a kick returner, a position that he excels at.

There isn't much to say about it this early in the process but it is worth noting that installing a new defense and a new offense is going to be a particular challenge for this group of coaches.  The reason is simple - most of them haven't done it before.  Indeed, most of them have never even seen it done.

Many of the Dolphins coaches, both offensive and defensive, have spent their entire careers in New England, where head coach Bill Belichick is an institution and where the organization has been a smoothly running machine for a very long time.  Belichick probably doesn't even remember how he went about installing the Patriot defense from scratch, let alone his assistants.

The problem highlights one of the challenges that comes with being a Belichick disciple.  Many of these guys have never been anywhere else.

For instance, they've never developed the contacts in the league which can be necessary to succeed as coaches, particularly head coaches in Brian Flores's case.  So what happens when you have to hire assistants?  You look for former Patriots because you've never worked anywhere else and you don't really know anyone else.

Having veteran coaches like Jim Caldwell can help.  But that will only take you so far.  Flores and his staff have their work cut out for them in this respect.

Armando Salguero at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article230422099.html}{writes about the definition of leadership by Dolphins head coach Brian Flores}: 

\begin{quote}
``'If you work hard and put the team first, you’re a leader,' Flores said. 'I want to have 53 leaders on our team. I want 90 on our team right now. That’s something that you can develop. That’s something that you can talk about.'''

``Flores is right to point out that players on other teams might stay away and be leaders.''

``But everyone in that room Tuesday knew I was asking about the Dolphins. And [Rashad] Jones.

``Is he a leader on the Dolphins?''
\end{quote}

I'm glad that Salguero is pressing the issue of Rashad Jones absence from OTAs in a year where a new coaching staff is trying to install a new defensive scheme.  But that aside, I continue to be astounded that Jones is still a part of this team at all.

I understand that cutting Jones post-June 1 would entail \href{https://overthecap.com/salary-cap/miami-dolphins/}{eating \$17 million dollars in dead cap money}.  But the Dolphins have plenty of cap space.

How can you keep a guy who basically quit on your team by refusing to enter a game last year?  I don't care what issues Jones had with defensive coordinator Matt Burke or head coach Adam Gase.  As Flores, himself, correctly points out above, none of your 53 ``leaders'' should ever put pride ahead of the team, especially if you are a serving as veteran example.

I understand that football players aren't all going to be angels.  But right now the focus has to be first and foremost on developing young players and establishing a positive team culture.

Similar to \href{https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/running-back-mark-walton-gets-second-chance-with-miami-dolphins}{the signing troubled running back Mark Walton}, I can't imagine what \href{https://www.phinmaniacs.com/news/points-of-view-from-a-dolphins-perspective}{a poor example} such ``veteran leadership'' will set for the youth on a rebuilding Dolphins team.

Every time Flores speaks to the team about ``putting the team first'', young eyes in that room will involuntarily turn to look at Jones (when he finally shows up).  I can't imagine the damage that will cause.

Armando Salguero at the Miami Herald \href{https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article230468024.html}{on the release of 2017 fifth round pick Isaac Asiata}:  

\begin{quote}
``[T]he frustrating thing about this pick is that Asiata was drafted out of Utah with the 164th selection. And with the 190th selection the Los Angeles Chargers selected Sam Tevi, who was on the same offensive line as Asiata at Utah.

``And Tevi was a backup as a rookie. And last year he started 15 games and won the starting right tackle job for the Chargers ahead of Joe Barksdale, who opened the door for Tevi when he got injured and then was cut when he got healthy because Tevi won the job outright.

``Somebody in the Dolphins’ personnel department studied the same Utah offensive line and picked the wrong guy.''
\end{quote}

In fairness, the Dolphins were still 2 years away from losing Ja'Wuan James to free agency.  They had just taken Laremy Tunsil in the first round in 2016 and they were just moving him to tackle.  They needed a guard.

Nevertheless, Salguero's point is excellent and well-taken.  Talent is talent and it isn't like the Dolphins couldn't have used a good developmental prospect that could serve as a back up in the meantime.

The situation highlights a fundamental problem.  The general manager can set the general direction of the franchise and help make some final decisions on the players.  But Chris Grier, even if he's the right guy for the job, can't be everywhere.  It takes a village to put together a good draft and if the scouts can't recognize talent when they see it, it results in an organizational failure.  The general manager is just the face of it.

This is an issue when you consider the fact that the Dolphins chose to stick with Grier rather than embrace big changes by hiring from the outside.  All the little indians underneath Grier stayed the same.  Here's hoping they improve their performance or it won't matter who the chief is.

\begin{quote}
``I’d say this year we had 170 players on the board [for 2019], which is way down from where it was before,' [General Manager Chris] Ballard said. 'I think last year we were at 220, I can’t even remember the number from my first year. But yeah, it makes it easier to navigate when you have fewer names that you know fit what you want. I think when we really get it right, and we get it down to about 125, 150, that’s when we’ll have really honed down exactly what a Colt is for our schemes.'''
\end{quote}

What the Colts are doing is a lesson for us all.  I have found that being brutal about cutting things out of my life, from tossing things from storage to pruning task lists, makes it a lot easier to get better results in the end.

Honestly, if you have something in your closet that you haven't touched for five years, are you really going to need it in the next 5?  Or the 5 after that?

Anyway, this is a sign that the Colts really know what they are doing.  The bet here is that going into the draft, any general manager worth his salt probably knows deep in his heart that there are only 50 or so players they are really likely they'll end up with.  Maybe even less.  So why put 350 on your board?

The ability to hone in on what's really important and trimming the rest seems to be one underrated key to success.

I understand why Daniel Snyder's Redskins might be the favorite.  Snyder seems like just the entrepreneur who would see this as an opportunity rather than a detriment.  Nevertheless my money's on the Raiders.

Mark Davis has been adamantly against this team appearing in the past.  But getting permission to move his franchise to Vegas undoubtedly came with a lot of strings attached behind the scenes.  The bet here is that it's not coincidence that the Rams both appeared on Hard Knocks and went to London to play after permission to move to Line of scrimmage Angeles was given.

Oakland plays a home game against the Bears in London this year and it would surprise no one if they ended up being forced to volunteer to be on Hard Knocks as well.

\begin{quote}
``If Gase is inclined to do it, now’s the time given his current power and control over the team.

The thought that the Jets would trade Bell is ridiculous.  The Jets have already paid Bell \$12 million and \href{https://overthecap.com/player/leveon-bell/2258/}{the cap hit if they traded him would be extremely high}.

Furthermore I have a hard time believing that anyone wouldn't want Le'Veon Bell, let alone an offensive coach like Gase.  I have little trouble believing that Gase thought they overpaid.  But the thought that Gase would trade him now that they've paid Bell is absurd.

Personally I never felt that John Clayton added much in the way of reporting when he was with ESPN.  And I definitely don’t think he knows what he’s talking about now.

David Furones at the South Florida Sun-Sentinal comments upon the situation of runningback Kenyan Drake:

\begin{quote}
  ``Under previous coach Adam Gase, Miami Dolphins running back Kenyan Drake’s workload would fluctuate from averaging 18 carries per game in the last five weeks of 2017 to having just 7.5 attempts per outing in 2018.''

  ``'He has a lot of skill and he’s working hard and he’s doing a lot of the things we’re asking him to do,' [Dolphins head coach Brian] Flores said. 'I think he’s obviously athletic, good hands, fast, elusive. He’s a good player. Working with him has been good.'''
\end{quote}

Even as Drake flashed potential last year, not many people around the team were advocating more playing time for him.  No one said it out right but the suspicion is that his work ethic wasn't up to snuff.  Apparently working with the veteran Frank Gore didn't bring it out of him.

It sounds like Drake is embracing his opportunity to work with the new staff and is looking at it as a fresh start.  Here's hoping it results in a more professional attitude and, as a results, benefits the Dolphins in a big way.

\begin{quote}
  ``There’s no doubt Miami must upgrade from last year’s starting duo of Davis and Ted Larsen, who is now with Chicago.

Amen.

This article highlights the past problem at guard and the fact that Davis is currently still the leading candidate to play right guard is an indication that the Dolphins have a long way to go at this position.  And the fact that third round draft pick Michael Deiter will likely beat out current starting left guard Chris Reed doesn't make me feel a lot better.  The fact is that this problem probably won’t be solved this year, at least on both both sides.

Many people have a habit of underestimating the importance of the guard position.  In fact, I used to be one of them.  But experience has taught me that this is the most important position on the offensive line.  Its easier to find guards like Deiter in the middle to late rounds of the draft.  But guard position, itself, is more important than tackle. Quarterbacks can step up in the pocket to escape defensive ends coming off the edge if the interior linemen do their job.  But no quarterback can throw with pressure in his face.

This is a huge problem that will likely stunt the performance of both Josh Rosen and Ryan Fitzpatrick along with the performance of the rest of the offensive players, will have to be judged with this in mind.

\begin{quote}
``Mizzell probably received the most criticism for a player not named \textbf{Cody Parkey} last season, which is impressive for someone who had only nine carries and eight receptions on 69 snaps. 

``He’ll have a lot of work to do to make the team in a crowded receivers room. This move clears up the running back depth chart a bit. It’s now \textbf{Kerrith Whyte Jr.} vs. \textbf{Ryan Nall} for the No. 4 spot.''
\end{quote}

Count me among those critical of the Bears use of Mizzell in any situation last year.  Sixty nine snaps is plenty enough to get on people's radar and, like many observers, I couldn't figure out why he was on the field at all.  It was evident to me that he just wasn't that good.

You wonder why the Bears don’t just release Mizzell. There must be something about him that someone likes, probably head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy}. He’s going to be a practice squad project at wide receiver and you wonder if that spot would be better used on someone else and if Mizzell, himself, would be better off going elsewhere without the position change where he’ll have a better chance to play.

From what I've seen the odds are slim that he'll ever develop into the kind of player that could crack the starting lineup with the Bears.

\begin{quote}
``'I feel like I can improve in a lot of areas,' Smith said.

``If we’re nitpicking, Smith needs to improve in coverage, but that should come through his own experiences, including in practices against running backs \textbf{Tarik Cohen} and \textbf{David Montgomery}. There is a significant difference between seeing an option route from a back on film and handling one at game speed.

``When [inside linebackers coach \textbf{Mark}] \textbf{DeLeone} evaluated Smith’s rookie film, he saw a young linebacker who started to shake off the 'rust' and improve as the weeks went by.''
\end{quote}

That's not nitpicking.  It was a serious problem and it wasn't just Smith.  The Bears were constantly getting burned last season as receivers dragged across the middle of the field where the inside linebackers failed to pick them up in coverage.

In fairness, it doesn't look like it's particularly easy to do.  I would imagine that it's tough enough to be completely aware of what's going on in front of you let alone of opposing players coming at you on routes from the side and slightly behind you.  Nevertheless, that's what these guys get paid to do.

Not to beat a dead horse but as DeLeone points out, you have to feel that Smith would have done a better job of getting on top of this had his agent not held him out.  Here's hoping that with a full offseason Smith, along with the other linebackers, does a better job of correcting this issue.

\begin{quote}
  ``'I think the sacks will come,' Monachino said. 'I think Leonard as a pure natural pass rusher has a bigger toolbox than anybody else I’m coaching right now. I want everybody to understand what I just said. The better rusher right now is No. 52. But the natural pass-rush ability, the pass-rush gene, No. 94 has it. As he gets better at one or two things, his numbers will go up. The thing that may happen first are the effective rushes.'''

  ``'This is a rare athlete playing the position.  There’s a whole bunch of guys that are great hammers and guys that have the pass-rush gene that have that dominant trait. This is a rare athlete for the position. I’ve coached a bunch of good ones. I’ve coached big ones, I’ve coached smart ones, I’ve coached fast ones. I’ve never coached an athlete like this.

  ``'… His length. His short-area quickness. Long speed. The ability to cover and change direction. All of those things are very special with this player.'''

  ``'He is more than willing to learn any way he can learn.   He’s learning on his own because he asks me great questions every day when he gets back into the building after he’s watched tape on his own. I think that the guy has a very, very high ceiling.'''
\end{quote}

The quotes show the difference between the current staff under new defensive coordinator \textbf{Chuck Pagano} and the understated style that former head coach \textbf{John Fox} and coordinator \textbf{Vic Fangio}.  ``Under promise and over deliver'' doesn't seem to be in anyone's mantra in May, that's for sure.

Personally, I like the Fox/Fangio way of handling these things.  Raising expectations to high level sets players that might otherwise be very solid up for what might be perceived as disappointing results.

There is a reason why Floyd hasn't been a great player on the field entering his third year.  True, he might bloom this year.  But I think setting him up to be more than he's shown that he is to this point might be unfair.

\begin{quote}
  ``With the Ravens hiring a new offensive coordinator this year, it probably shouldn't have come as a surprise to anyone in Baltimore that the team would be installing a new offense this offseason, but apparently, no one told Lamar Jackson.
  
``When Jackson showed up for the team's first round of offseason training activities (OTAs) last week, the Ravens quarterback literally had no idea that he was going to be spending his week implementing a new offense. 

``'Coming in, I didn't know we would have a totally different offense,' Jackson admitted, via the Ravens' official website. 'When I got here, coach was like, 'Yea, we have a totally new system. You're going to have go through this and that.' It's been getting to me a little bit.'''
\end{quote}

I'm completely torn on this article.  I don't know what is worse, having a quarterback who didn't move to find out if the offense would be different or having a coordinator who didn't tell him.

One thing is for sure.  Communication was definitely lacking.  I can't believe that the team didn't have the new offensive coordinator talking to the player to at least that extent.  And I can't believe that the player wasn't demanding to talk to the offensive coordinator to make sure they were on the same page and that he would be prepared for workouts.

Baltimore has a well-deserved reputation for being a well-run organization.  But it looks like multiple people dropped the ball here.  Its not that they can't recover from a slow start in May.  But that fact that it happened at all isn't a great sign of things to come.

Adam Jahns at The Athletic writes about \href{https://theathletic.com/996911/2019/05/28/forget-continuity-heres-why-change-should-benefit-the-bears-defense/}{the effect of change} upon an already very good Bears defense.  New defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano is overhauling the defense despite taking over a very successful unit from last years defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who moved on to become the head coach in Denver.  The Dolphins are undergoing even more drastic changes under never head coach Brian Flores.

\begin{quote}
``Four different assistants — [outside linebackers coach Ted Monachino, [safeties coach Sean] coach Desai, [defensive line coach Jay] Rodgers and new linebackers coach Mark DeLeone — suggested that new voices should help combat complacency from players.

``'At the end of the day, if you walk into a meeting room thinking that you know everything, you may miss some points,' Rodgers said. 'And if something comes in that’s maybe a little bit different, you’ve got to pay attention a little bit more, so when your turn is up, you’re able to execute the way we expect you to execute.

``'There’s some things that from a language standpoint that may be a little bit different, but at the end of the day, the guys are focused in on what they need to do to be really good at what they do.'''
\end{quote}

This is why analysts who are \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-brian-flores-20190524-vsfblusmmbdnjgxu7xmn53k2ka-story.html}{predicting things like ridiculous 0-16 seasons} for the Dolphins are wrong.  Its because it takes more than lack of talent to result in historically bad teams.

No first year head coach has ever gone 0-16.  Rod Marinelli was in his third with the Lions in 2008 and Hue Jackson was in his second with the Browns in 2017.

The Dolphins do have holes all over the field with important positions on the offensive line, at pass rusher and at cornerback filled with mediocre to less than mediocre players.  But all of those players are, or should be, laser focused as new playbooks are installed and as relationships with new coaches are built.  And every job is wide open as new coaches without preconceptions watch practices with a neutral eye that may decide that a long time starter shouldn't be given his position and that maybe a relative unknown should be given a shot. 

Dolphins coaches will naturally have an easier time getting the most out of their players this year.  And that could produce a pleasant surprise with a better than expected season.  But at worst, it won't produce anything historically bad.

\begin{quote}
``How will \textbf{Buster Skrine} fit into the Bears defense to replace \textbf{Bryce Callahan}? A lot of fans have been calling him a downgrade. — @sam_gutterman

``Skrine projects to be a good fit. He didn’t have his best season last year with the Jets, but the struggles came mostly when he was forced to play on the outside because of injuries. Skrine has also been more durable than Callahan. He has missed a total of five games over the last three seasons but didn’t miss a single game in his first five seasons in the league. Durability was a knock on Callahan, who wound up getting more money from the Broncos than the Bears wanted to pay. I like the idea of adding a proven veteran at the nickel spot with Callahan departed. Skrine will be better than he was with the Jets because he has a much more talented pass rush in front of him.''
\end{quote}

I don't think many people locally are calling the addition of Skrine a downgrade.  Head coach \textbf{Matt Nagy} highlighted Skrine last year before the Bears played the Jets as one of their best players and its obvious that they signed him largely because of what they saw on tape in preparation for that game.

The one thing to keep in mind is that Skrine is 30 years old.  That means he might be a good fill in for a while but he's also not the future at that position.  The Bears drafted \textbf{Duke Shelly} out of Kansas State in the sixth round but I wouldn't hold my breath that he'll work out there as a starter.  Although he's reportedly a fine athlete, he's only 5'9''.  Admittedly you don't need the height playing nickel back that you do if you are playing on the outside but Shelly will still have to show that he can overcome that lack of height to cover taller receivers on the inside.

Losses of the Bryce Callahan-type are inevitable in the salary cap era of the NFL and as those types of losses go, Callahan isn't a huge one.  But I would say that the loss of Callahan did leave a hole on the defense long-term and that the Bears will be spending some time as they approach the draft for the next year or two looking for potential replacements.

\begin{quote}
``Why move \textbf{Bradley Sowell} to tight end? There’s much less depth at tackle than there is at tight end to begin with. Now with Sowell at tight end, he has no shot at making the roster with \textbf{Trey Burton}, \textbf{Adam Shaheen}, \textbf{Ben Braunecker} and \textbf{Dax Raymond} ahead of him. Why not just keep him at swing tackle? — @bearsest1920

``For starters, I don’t think the Bears would have shifted Sowell if they didn’t feel pretty good about their options at swing tackle. \textbf{Rashaad Coward} was the first player coach Matt Nagy mentioned when I asked about that position last week after Sowell’s position switch was revealed. \textbf{Cornelius Lucas} might be another option. He has eight career starts and was once a relatively well-regarded prospect for the Lions. The thing you’re missing here is the Bears want Sowell at tight end because of his blocking ability. You’re right. He doesn’t offer as much in the passing game as the tight ends you referenced. None of those tight ends can block as well as Sowell, however, and they felt they were a little light at the Y position, which is a blocking tight end. Sowell essentially was a blocking tight end last season when the Bears would bring him in to play in heavy packages and he reported as eligible. The odds might be stacked against him to make the final roster, but I would not rule it out.
\end{quote}

I'm going to completely disagree with the questioner here and even mildly disagree with Biggs.

For whatever reason the Bears decided not to draft a tight end this year despite the fact that the depth at the position was pretty good, at least as far as the larger blocking-type go.  Raymond is 245 pounds which would probably make him more of an option to back up Burton at the move tight end unless he gains some weight.   The Bears seem to be banking heavily that Shaheen will take a step forward here in that respect.

Moving Sowell to tight end gives them another option to back up Shaheen.  But more important, because Sowell can also play tackle, he offers the type of position versatility that might allow the Bears to keep him on the roster where they otherwise might not have.  I'd say he's increased his chances not decreased them with this move.  Indeed, in obvious running situations Sowell will likely be a better option than Shaheen and he might see some playing time.

\begin{quote}
``Luckily for [Josh] Rosen, he has had some recent experience in a similar scheme.

``Rosen revealed the new Dolphins offense has some basic similarities to the first of two offenses he ran last year as a rookie under former Arizona Cardinals coordinator Mike McCoy, who was fired after six games last season.

``McCoy worked under current Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels when they were with the Denver Broncos in 2009-10, while O’Shea learned McDaniels’ scheme in New England since 2012.

``Miami Dolphins quarterback Josh Rosen discusses the most difficult part of the offensive system.
'That tree kinda falls here,' Rosen said of the coaching circle before describing the essence of his new offense.

``It can take a lot of time to get to the point where you can simply concentrate on the opposing defense.''
\end{quote}

Exactly.

Rosen is very lucky here and so are the Dolphins.  Young quarterbacks can sometimes take a full season with a new before they get to the point where they can stop concentrating on their own offense and start concentrating on the game plan for the upcoming opponent.

What is more likely to hold Rosen back is how the other players on the field adjust to the new scheme rather than how he does.  Nevertheless, this is yet another reason why the Dolphins coaching staff should be able to get a good handle on Rosen over the course of just one season to make a judgment about whether he should be the franchise going forward.

Repair man came some time between 9 and 9:30.

He said that the signal was low but that wasn't the major problem.  They'll take care of that later because the problem  is outside the building.

Apparently the splitter was bad and the TiVO was broken.  He replaced the box.  I lost all of my recordings but no big deal.

``This conversational dust-up over Jones of the past several weeks was ritual nonsense. It missed the real issue of this simply being a bad\

injured (both shoulder labrums have been rebuilt). He's proud (he refused to play last season rather than rotate).

``For that matter, the Dolphins are everything a veteran like Jones t want. They're torn down. They can't win. They're looking down the tim\
eline to winning in two or three years. Why put a ravaged body on the line for a team that can't win?''                                     
\end{quote}                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                            
There are rumors that the Dolphins are tying to trade Jones but they can't get what they want.  They have evidently decided that they best \
thing to do is wait the league out in the hopes that a desperate team on the cusp of winning will pay more if they lose a good safety in tr\
aining camp.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                            
If this is what they are doing, I do not agree with this decision.   Good strong safties are a dime a dozen this year and no one is going t\
o give you much for an injured one, even one that is among the best in the league at it.                                                    
                                                                                                                                            
More importantly, every day that a player who put his pride ahead of the team and refused to play remains on this young, impressionable ros\
ter does irreparable damage to the mentality of the other players.  Every time head coach Brian flores talks about putting the team first w\
ith Jones in the room his credibiliity takes a hit.

``Linebacker and defensive tackle depth seem to be biggest needs on defense. Who are the free-agent targets that would best fit? — @jokertownhero


``The Bears have pretty good depth at defensive tackle. Look at \textbf{Eddie Goldman}, \textbf{Bilal Nichols} and \textbf{Akiem Hicks}, who plays inside, and you’re talking about a really talented top three. \textbf{Nick Williams} has been around and he knows the scheme. I disagree that this is an area of need for depth. I also think the Bears are in pretty good shape at linebacker. There aren’t quality pass rushers on the street, and when you have a group headlined by \textbf{Khalil Mack}, \textbf{Leonard Floyd} and \textbf{Aaron Lynch} at outside linebacker, that’s good to me. They’ve got some decent reserves, too, including \textbf{Isaiah Irving}. At inside linebacker, \textbf{Nick Kwiatkoski} and \textsf{Joel Iyiegbuniwe} are behind starters \textbf{Danny Trevathan} and \textbf{Roquan Smith}. \textbf{Josh Woods} is another reserve to keep an eye on. He impressed the team last year as a rookie on the practice field. I don’t see depth issues at these positions.
\end{quote}

The guess here is that the questioner isn’t impressed Nichols and Irving as quality back ups.   A year ago this time I would have agreed with this assessment as lack of depth was one of the reasons I gave for predicting a last place finish for the Bears.  However, I don't agree now.

Irving and Nichols both impressed me in the preseason last year with the progress that they had made in terms of their play.  Both looked to me like they could play in the regular season if a veteran went down and provide average productivity (which is as much as you can ask of a back up).

Both have now had an additional year to develop, with Nichols seeing significant playing time.  That's good because although the Bears depth wasn't tested much last year, it almost certainly will be this year.  They are probably going to need one or both of these players to be able to step in.

Chris Perkins at The Athletic \href{https://theathletic.com/1013085/2019/06/05/rosen-and-fitzpatrick-have-vastly-differing-thoughts-on-dolphins-qb-battle/}{declares Ryan Fitzpatrick to be way ahead in the quarterback competition} and has him as "the clear favorite right now".  He says that "Right now, Fitzpatrick is the man."

I'm not entirely sure where this is coming from but many reporters around time seem convinced that this is a real competition.  Dave Hyde at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel is one of the few that seems to be taking it a step further to see the "competition" as a good thing for Rosen.  But at the same time, \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-hyde-dolphins-qbs--20190606-p47uiimvcrd23bwerijibktbfq-story.html}{he knows that its not exactly real}:

\begin{quote}
``The question the Dolphins will wrestle with until the opening game — and probably beyond — isn’t if Fitzpatrick gives them a better chance to win the next Sunday. It’s how Rosen would look by November with a couple of months of starts under him.

``It’s whether you go with the 37-year-old you know or the 22-year-old you don’t know. It’s a philosophical one, you see, more than strictly a football one.

``Bill Parcells always said the hardest decision for a coach wasn’t deciding if a proven veteran was better at that moment than a young player. It was looking two months down the line and deciding if that rookie would be better than the veteran by then if given the full chance to play.''
\end{quote}

Exactly.

What few people in the media seem to be acknowledging right now is that what the Dolphins aren't actually deciding if Fitpatrick is better.  Of course he's better.  Rosen is in only his second year and probably has not had the best of coaching up to this point.  What the Dolphins have to decide over the next few months is if Rosen is the future.  And that's more difficult because it involves projecting his development through this year and beyond.

One thing is certain.  The Dolphins don't have to show it externally but internally they have to totally commit to Rosen until they've made a decision on him.  He has to be nurtured and every opportunity to help him and evaluate him has to be taken.  And that means two things:

\begin{enumerate}
\item This isn't a competition.  Or more accurately, it isn't a
  competition between Rosen and Fitzgerald.  Because Fitzgerald's
  performance isn't relevant to the decision.  What Rosen has to do -
  and his comments indicate that on some level he understand this - is
  to prove to the Dolphins not that he's a franchise quarterback now
  but that he will be at some time into the future.
\item The Dolphins have to start Rosen until they've made up their
  mind that he's never going to be at least part of the answer to
  their quarterback problem, even if its just as a cheap, long-term
  back up.  If Rosen isn't starting week 1, it means they've already
  made up their mind.  And that will mean bad things for his future in
  the league.
\end{enumerate}

Already working to improve his production as a receiver, Gesicki also looks to shed the label of exclusively being a pass-catching tight end.

\begin{quote}
“I need to be able to contribute in all phases,” he said. “I need to be able to run block. I need to be able to pass block. I need to be able to run the routes, do everything. I can’t just go out and pass plays and sit out on run plays, so I got to be able to do it all.”
\end{quote}

I was almost disappointed to read this.  It means that Gesicki hasn't totally moved on from his year with former head coach Adam Gase.

I'm not one of those guys who constantly bashes a coach or executive once they leave town.  But in my opinion, Gase did Gesicki no favors by expecting him to block too much as a tight end.  Gase came from the Mike Martz school of offense where tight ends are there to block and if you want to set up a mismatch, you go with the big wide receiver.

The modern NFL works differently and Gesicki is a modern NFL tight end.  At 6'6'', 245 pounds he was drafted to catch passes, particularly as a red zone weapon, not block.  The Dolphins have Dwayne Allen to do that and he's pretty good at it when he's healthy.

The good news is that this doesn’t necessarily mean that Geseki will continue to be misused. When asked about Gesicki, current head coach Brian Flores didn't mention Gesicki's blocking.

\begin{quote}
  ``'I talked to him about this [Wednesday] morning,' Flores said. 'One drop is one too many; one penalty is one too many; one missed assignment is one too many. That’s kind of the standard, the approach we’re taking.'''
  ``'[Gesicki is] very talented. He’s working very, very hard. He’s catching the ball decently.'''
\end{quote}

I would say that's what he needs to hear.

\begin{quote}
Q: The point of the defense is to have multiple looks and be confusing, to throw people off. How hard is it to learn it if that’s the point of the whole scheme?

A: “It’s really not that hard. It’s more just you learn the concepts, you can just start pluggin in guys. If you just learn the concept of where the defense is at, it don’t matter who you put there. That part is easy. But at first it was a little hard, understanding it’s not learning one job, it’s about learning the concept as a whole. After a while, once you get that, the rest is pretty simple.”

Q: So it’s a different concept for the interior linemen, a different one for the outside linebackers, a different one if you’re a defensive back coming into the box?

A: “We all have our different adjustments, and little concepts as a whole. Linebackers can help the D-line if they line up this way. Linebackers can help the safeties if we just show inside or something like that. Really, you just have to learn the defense, what’s your role in it, and help other guys.”
\end{quote}

This is a facinating quote that gives some insight into how this defense will run.  It appears that, at least at the moment, the Dolphins are expecting players to have more than the usual degree of global persepctive in terms of how the defense runs and how their position fits into it.  This will allow them to take on slightly different roles depending upon the situation not by memorizing specific duties but by looking at it from a mechanistic perspective so that what they need to do simply makes sense.

It all sounds good in theory.  But let's remember that it really hasn't worked well to this point unless Bill Belichick was running the show in New England.  It will be interesting to see whether head coach Brian Flores has the right touch to bring it to Miami.

  Analyzed 2019-05-31 ro 2019-06-07.  I'm concerned about the analysis.
  
  It looks to me like the "best" cells from Dan showed a difference in the time to 90% decline.  These were 2019-06-07-2 and 2019-06-07-3.  These were collected after Dan uped the ISO concentrtion to 2 uM.
  
  What is concerning is that band 3 shows a linear decline in these cells.  This might be due to a gradual drift in the analysis due to the fact that the stimulation rate wasn't exactly 0.5 Hz.  The "time to 90%" may have actually been the time to the end of the segment that I was analyzing.  This should, of course have been a window where the fill transient could be visualized.  However, it was obvious that it was cutting off part way down the transient late in the analysis at the later time points.

- The other thing that worries me is that I think we need control data to make sure that even the data that we didn't think came from "good" cells showed a decline in both time to peak and time to 90%.

- I think we should keep the ISO at 2 uM

- *I think we need control data to make sure that what I'm seeing isn't an artifact.*

This was in part because of the those present were chiming in but it was also in part because the neurologists were experts that were teaching beyond what an M1 needs to know.  The suggesiton was that maybe the CEs should teach things like this.  It probalby won't be a problem in other blocks as the "experts" are few and far between right now.

  Reanalyzed 2019-06-07-2 and 2019-06-07-3.
  
  Reanalysis 1 was simply playing with the begin and end transient times to center the transients since we weren't at exactly 0.5 Hz.
  
  Reanalysis 2 was reanalysis 1 with a 9 point box car smooth.
  
  Both sets of data look better.
  
  Still no differences in either cell in the time to half max.
  
  Cell 2 seems to definitely have a slower response in band 3 than bands 1 and 2 in the time to 90% decline.  This confirms what the first analysis showed but the data look better and less like it might be artifact.
  
  Interestingly, cell 3 had no shortening at all in band 3 for time to 90% decline.  And there appears to be a real difference between bands 1 and 2 (unlike cell 2).
  
  Reanalysis 2 has all of the parameters hard coded in so I'll know exactly what I used.

  2019-06-11 was all control data with no ISO perfusion.  I did some analysis of the 2019-06-11 data but didn't finish.  The analysis of the cells up to number 10 was wrong because I wasn't using the right spatial parameters.  I'll have to redo cells 5-9.
  
  Cells 10 and 11 were done correctly and showed no decline in the time to half decline or time to 90% decline.  So I' reasonably confident that the analysis isn't adding any artifacts.
  
  2019-06-12 was all ISO data.  All bands in Cells 1,3 and 4 declined but cells 1 and 3 didn't show any apparent difference in the decline of the times to half and 90%.
  
  Only cell 4 showed the response we are looking 4.  Band 3 definitely responded late and possibly more slowly to the ISO for both the time to 50% decline and time to 90% decline.
  
  Interpretation:
  
  * The mathematical analysis isn't adding an artifact.
  
  * I'm a bit concerned about the "time to declines" that I'm getting in terms of the numbers.  Given that the whole transient should be only 2000 ms long, a time to 90% decline of 3000 seems wrong.  I'll have to take a further look at the code to see where this discrepancy is coming from.
  
  * I think Dan might be hitting too much of the cell on some of these so that the ISO effect disappears.  Given the amount of trouble he's having controlling this, I may have to do some further analysis in order to make this data quantitative.
  
  I'm thinking of keeping the 50 pixel banding but moving down the cell line by line (average of 25 pixels on each side).  I'll look at each line and determine when they hit some mark, let's say a time to 25% decline in time to 90%.  I'll determine more or less where along the length of the cell the first delay in this time seems to be and figure that's where the ISO stops hitting the cell.  From there, determining the rate at which the response propagates up the cell whouldn't be hard.

  Only analyzed cells 3 and 4.
  
  This revised analysis is a moving spatial average of the flursesence.  So, for instance, the first "band" of the 25 μm is actually centered on a line 12.5 μm from the edge with a total width of 25.  The analysis then moves 1 pixel over and repeats for the next band.  This gives filtered data over the entire length of the cell.
  
  I also generated figures which have band number on the x axis.  In this case, each line represents a transient.  My hope is that I can better localize exactly where the ISO is hitting the cell by looking at which band immediately respond to the ISO (those that are being perfused) and which are delayed and by how much (the longer the delay, the further from the region being perfused.
  
  This led to some interesting results.
  
  It looks like the ISO hit cell 4 about half way up.  This needs to be looked at further.  The cell responded well and You can definitely see a spatial gradient in the response in terms of time to half decline, time to 90% decline and transient peak.
  
  There might be something there in cell 3.  The transient peak data seems to show a gradient but its hard to tell.  This data really needs to be normalized to the intial level.

Note also that I fixed the time bug.  The times to half and 90% decline should be accurate now.

  I also reanalyzed 2019-06-12-03 and 2019-06-12-04 so that the normalized graphs would be generated.  Should make it easier to evaluate this data, especially 03.

  Added a normalization protocol to the analysis so that now we have graphs of data normalized to the initial levels.
  
  2019-06-12-01
  This cell actually did respond to ISO but the transient data kind of looks like it responded in the middle and them the response diffused out to the ends.  The time to declines who a gradient only on the top end.  Note the band data where the final decrease in time to 90% takes place very lat at the very top 20% or so.  Dan hit this one really high be there might be something we can get out of it.
  
  2019-06-11-09 to 11
  These were the only control cells that I analyzed.  I'll go back and reanalyze later.  Suffice it to say that there was no apparent change due to the analysis and there do not appear to be any artifacts added on that account.
  
  2019-06-07-4
  There definitely is a gradient here in the time to 90% decline.  There's nothing there in the time to half decline.  The gradient is there in the peak transients as well.
  
  Both seem to show that the response basically stops and doesn't make it all the way up the cell.
  
  2019-06-07-3
  
  Note that the profile for this cell went all the way to the edge.  Used 500.
  
  There's some unsteadiness in the peak transient data over time but it looks like there's a gradient there.   When You look at the raw transient traces over time it does look like the peaks go up and down a bit.  May not be able to use this.
  
  The band Vs. tt90 data seems to show that this cell got hit about halfway up.  Definitely a gradient in this data but its very noisy.  There might be something in the tt50 but its too noisy to tease out.
  
  2019-06-07-2
  
  There might be a gradient in the tt90 data but I wouldn't bet that it will amount to anything.   Nothing in the tt50 data.
  
  The transient peak data shows a definite gradient.  The 25 um band data looks better.

  It wasn't a huge surprise but Gary wasn't ready to record.  I showed him how I set things up and we got him up and running on ExamSoft so he can look at the questions and target the correct material in his videos.
  
  Also no surprise but he decided to go with videos only.  So he obviosuly didn't get much done the first part of the month on his notes.

\begin{quote}
``[[\textbf{Paxton}] \textbf{Lynch} is getting a second chance in Seattle after the former first round pick of the Denver Broncos flamed out after just two years with the team. [\textbf{Geno}] \textbf{Smith} is on his third new team in as many years after stops with the New York Giants and Los Angeles Chargers.

``'Paxton’s got a big time, live arm. He really does,' offensive coordinator \textbf{Brian Schottenehimer} said. 'For a big guy, he’s really quick and athletic, picked up the system well. Geno hasn’t been here nearly as long. He’s got a lot of moxie about him, great huddle command which is cool to see.'''
\end{quote}

I think we know who Smith is.  I'm not as sure about Lynch.

\href{https://predominantlyorange.com/2017/06/29/nfl-scout-says-paxton-lynch-miscast-gary-kubiaks-offense/}{Many have speculated that Lynch wasn't the best fit in the offense in Denver} and that may have been part of the reason he didn't develop.

So much of properly developing a quarterback has to do with pairing him with the right coaching staff.  You wonder how many of the busts over the last 30 years would have been stars had they been in the proper nurturing environment early on.

In any case Seattle is \textbf{Pete Carroll} is far more likely to adjust to Lynch's skill set.  Not that he's likely to get a chance to show it because quarterback \textbf{Russell Wilson} is a bit of an iron man but it will be interesting to see if Lynch does better there if he gets a chance to show it.

  What I took away from this was that if you deal with anyone outside of the US, you have to declare it as a potential conflict of interest to Rush.  It may not ultimately be determined to be one.  In fact, probably not.  But they want it all reported and they will make the decision.

  Gary will upload his materials to the GD and will share it with me.  The materials will have the video order.  Once I have that, I'll upload them to YouTube, move his materials to the proper folder for the course and he'll be done.

  Used to be Angela May?
  
  We went over Angela's test exam breakdown (not the exam which is, of course, off limits at this point since many questions are the same).  She did poorly in anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology.  I recommended active study techniques (image occlusion and Note cards) and that she review the old physiology exam questions.  I also sent her links to the updated computer programs online and asked for bug reports.

*** 2019-07-07 Sunday
**** Just finishing up a trip to St. Charles for the Fourth of July.

Its been a nice weekend.  Came down to the Lake of the Ozarks Wednesday morning and we came straight down.

Tried to "help" Mom by pairing her phone to the car so that things like remote start could work.  I'm pretty sure the only thing I did was mess up what little did work by deleting the existing blue tooth connections.  Who'd have thought that getting it to pair with a new phone would be so difficult?  It didn't even offer th eopportunity to do so.  There's probably some setting deep within the interface that allws it but, really, it shouldn't be that difficult.  Once yo venture outside the Apple system, things sometimes just don't work easily.

Anyway, I'll have to admit to Mom and Da that I messed it up.  Dad pretty much suspects already.  He'll have to take it to the dealer and get her phone re-paired with the car.  I'll wait to tell him until after I leave.  I really don't want to hear about it.

It rained pretty much all day Friday and it was beautiful.  I wish I'd had the presence of mind to take a picture do I could put it here.

I am re-reading The Agony and the Extacy and started to fear tha I'd finish it before I left.  I've done a lot of sitting and reading in the sun which, of course, is great.  I would ordinarily have packed another book but I was trying to pack light to keep the backpack from overflowing.  

I bought another book yesterday.  "This Case is Gonna Kill Me" by Phillip Bornikova.  It was 60% off at Publisher's Clearing House and the jacket makes it sound a bit light and funny.  If I don't start it before heading home I'll keep it in reserve.

Wireless internet fown here sucks.  I ran up against my data limit on my phone because I was tethering so I called and uppped the limit to 6 Gigabites.  I will probably reduce it back down to 2 G next month but I've been running up agains ttha tlimit a lot so maybe not.  I'll see what the bill is.

the only thing that really marred the weekend was the constant bitching about Colleen's financial situation.  This is frustrating because I have to hear about it but they won't let me help and I cna't do anything about it.  I try to change the subject but it jest comes back again.  I guess listening to this is my job.  There are certainly worse things.

Heading to 8AM mass in about an hour at Our Lady of the Lake.  Mom and Dad will go to 10 and after clean up we'll head back to St. Charles.  Greg and Beth are hosting the family for dinner.  Greg has an early flight like me so it will be an early night.
***** Consider reducing the data limit fo the phone back down to 2G.

Hi Gary,

We're thinking the DDx for AUB in different ages is beyond the level of M2s and also, they haven't had these diseases (cancers etc).  Can this activity be simplified?

\begin{quote}
The point here isn’t to push for [Justin] Herbert, [Tua] Tagoviloa or [Josh] Rosen. It’s to keep an open mind. A year ago, no one thought Kyler Murray was a No. 1 pick. Let the information come to you before pounding the table with a decision. And, remember, no decision is needed until next spring.
\end{quote}

This really is the major point.  It's not about speculation and Omar Kelly-style judgments about young quarterbacks in June.  It's about simply relaxing, watching to see what happens and enjoying the process.

\begin{quote}
You wish Jim Caldwell all the best in his taking care of his health. You also understand this was a loss to this season’s plans. Caldwell was the only one with head-coaching experience on the Dolphins staff. As such, he’d be a sounding board for Brian Flores. Even more than that, he was a hands-on coach of the quarterbacks. And have you heard the Dolphins are looking for a quarterback? So the Dolphins don’t just lose the wise, old man who’s been up the mountain but a guide to the position that’s befuddled this franchise for a couple of decades.
\end{quote}

As Hyde points out, Caldwell wasn't just a guy with head coaching experience.  In my book that was a relatively minor role.  The big issue was that he was the quarterback coach.  Offensive coordinator Chad O'Shea coached wide receivers with the Patriots.  That leaves assistant quarterbacks coach Jerry Schuplinski, a guy who coached only veteran Tom Brady and who probably earned more from Brady than Brady ever learned from him.

The cards are once again stacking up against Josh Rosen ever developing as an NFL quarterback.  A guy who went through a terrible rookie years with two bad offensive coodinators under a defensive head coach last year, he's evidently going to have to go through one with another defensive head coach, an offensive coordinator who doesn't coach quarterbacks and a quarterback coach who has worked only with the most veteran of veteran quarterbacks.  Rosen's only prayer is that Schuplinski picked something up as they developed back ups like Jimmy Garoppolo and that 17 year veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick might have mercy and find some time to teach him something even as he does everything he can to keep him off the field.

I'm willing to wait and see but its hard to be optimistic.

One more quick side pont about Caldwell.  He was undoubtedly the reason why Jake Ruddock is the third quarterback on this roster.  He spent much of his career as a back up with the Lions.  What the loss of Caldwell as an every day presence does to his chances of making the roster are uncertain.  The Dolphins will probably just roll with him at this point but this can't bode well for him.

Omar Kelly at the Sun-Sentinel goes through the story lines to watch as training camp approaches.  He correctly \href{https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-dolphins-camp-countdown2-20190716-pjsxv2okvncgnnoz5lqs4wyt3u-story.html}{identifies the situation at safety as a continuing issue}.

\begin{quote}
  ``[T]the key is finding a way to make [Reshad] Jones and [T.J] McDonald play well together, injecting their power and playmaking into a defense that will need plenty of each to be respectable again.''
\end{quote}

In some ways the Dolphins have a good problem on their hands.  Unlike the other defensive positions, they have three talented safties in McDonald, Jones and Minkah Fitzpatrick and they have an emerging free safety option in Bobby McCain.  But even good problems are problems.  Even if they play Fitzpatrick in what amounts to the nickel cornerback role, they can't get all of these guys on the field at the same time.  And we already know that isn't going to sit well with Jones, at least.

One option is to play McDonald in what amounts to a linebacker role.  This has been speculated upon since the Dolphins traded for McDonald and signed him to a long-term deal.  He's big enough to do it and his adding mobility on the outside of a 3-4 defense is an intriguing idea.

Another is to give up the ghost on Jones and trade him, something they really should have done before now.  As I've pointed out before, the Dolphins are sending a terrible message to their young players by keeping the prideful and selfish Jones on the team.

In any case, the Dolphins are still paying the price of the poor team building of the previous (and in some ways the current) regime.  Here's hoping they finally solve this issue in a way that maximizes their assets.

\textbf{Adam Jahns} at \textit{The Athletic} emphasizes that fans \href{https://theathletic.com/1088301/2019/07/21/living-in-the-past-is-a-bears-tradition-but-the-2019-team-is-more-important-than-any-anniversary/?source=rss}{shouldn't let the 100 year anniversary of the Bears overshadow the importance of the 2019 version of the team making progress}.  He particularly emphasizes the importance of quarterback \textbf{Mitch Trubisky}'s continued progress:

\begin{quote}
“The word that comes to mind for me is incremental improvement, steady incremental improvement, and I think we’ve seen (Trubisky) do that,” [general manager \textbf{Ryan}] \textbf{Pace} said Sunday. “And as long as he just keeps on that pace, steady incremental improvement, we’ll be happy. You can feel his confidence growing; we’ve talked about that. Chemistry, continuity, all those things going into Year 2, and that’s going to continue as we go forward.”
\end{quote}

It is important to Note that this continued, steady improvement will be the biggest key to the 2019 season.  Trubisky is one of the most polarizing quarterbacks in the entire league right now.  YOu either really like him or your really, really don't.

Amongst my friends who root for other teams, most of whom are typical, I'd say 80\% will literally tell you that Trubisky is terrible and they don't understand the hype.  And there's good reason for their skepticism.

Even most objective Bears fans would have to admit that Trubisky was league average at best at the end of the year.  And that was, as Pace points out, after making steady progress throughout the 2018 campaign.  Its important to note that expecting anything beyond that is all extrapolation based upon the assumption that he's going to continue to progress

You to have had the opportunity to watch Trubisky make that steady progress last year, game after game, before you could actually get the feeling that he might be on his way to something special.  And what's going to be very interesting about this year is that it won't be just Bears fans who are going to see it.  Trubisky's progress is going to be a national story as the Bears are on national television six times, the maximum allowed.  

Until Trubisky actually shows that he's a very good quarterback,  he's just another guy.  If the Bears are going to remain competitive, he's going to have to become more than that.  Its far from a certainty that will happen.  But either way its going to be what we will all be watching for all over the league this year.

Hi, guys.

Just a quick note on where we are at with the faculty guides and the session activities.

1.  Some general edits:

I need to check the dates in the headers of all of these guides.  I’ll get that done ASAP.

We need to update the contact information for Microbiology.  Presumably this will be Nell and Paria but Paria hasn’t been officially hired.  I’ll put Nell’s info in.

2.  Keith - Abnormal Uterine bleeding is basically done.   Mark Pool is going to find out how to create links to the virtual slides and embed them into the guide so that the students can get a good, high resolution look at them.  Other than that, it should be good to go.

3.  Carl - Pelvic inflammatory disease is almost done as well.  Gary has a minor edit for the women’s health activity where he’s going to make sure the students know what they need to take away from the tables in the answers.

4.  Keith - Infertility:  Anne is working a little bit on the clinical reasoning.  Jerry is going to design a pathology activity to replace the physiology activity from last year.  Frankly, this concept map wasn’t my best work and the students correctly pointed out that we need more pathology activities in this block.

5.  Keith - Teen pregnancy:  Anne is working a little bit on the clinical reasoning.  Other than that it looks pretty solid.

Fetal Death is the last case in this block and we’ll talk about it next week.  The due date for Vital Fluids self-study materials is August 8 so we will likely move right into those guides on the 9th.

Thanks to all for your help.

Greetings Everyone ,

I would like to share some exciting news in RMC, Office of Integrated Medical Education.

Jill Volk, director of admissions and recruitment has been promoted to Director of Diversity and Inclusion, Outreach and Recruitment for RMC, Office of Integrated Medical Education.  In this role Jill will combine her experience, expertise and strong leadership skills in working with UME and GME, to provide outreach, recruitment, retention and mentoring for students, house staff and fellows who are underrepresented in medicine (URM).  She will help foster and maintain a safe, inclusive and welcoming medical college climate for URMs.  Specifically, and in concert with the senior associate
 dean for D&I, Jill will also develop and implement a comprehensive diversity and inclusion
strategic plan.

Jill has a longstanding history of leadership and service at Rush that spans over two decades.
She began her career in the University where she served as director of student affairs managing office operations and the student activity budget, advising and developing student organizations, and providing career services opportunities to all university students.  Prior to her current role in RMC, Jill managed the RMC special programs/events, provided career counseling, advised first and second year students, served as the student liaison to the dean’s office, and RMC liaison to RU student services, financial affairs and the AOA chancellor.

Jill will continue in her role as director of admissions and recruitment, implementing the admissions and recruitment strategic plan and providing ongoing leadership and successful outcomes for increasing URMs in UME.  She brings a strong knowledge base of holistic review in admissions with successful URM recruitment and enrollment strategies.  Jill is active nationally with the Association of American Medical Colleges Group on Student Affairs (GSA) where she recently completed five years of service as Secretary and Treasurer for the GSA Central Region.  We look forward to her continued leadership and success in her new role.

Lolesia (“Lisa”) Johnson has been promoted to Project Manager for Diversity and Inclusion for RMC in the Office of Integrated Medical Education.   In her new role Lisa will serve as the primary point of contact for all key stakeholders to organize and manage the RMC D&I strategic plan and also serve as a liaison and strategic partner with department chairs, residency program directors, clerkship directors, the GME Diversity Equity and Inclusion Committee, Diversity Leadership Council and other key Rush university and medical college faculty, administrators and stakeholders to further advance RMC’s mission and URM diversity goals.   Lisa will work closely with the director and senior associate dean in creating innovative and new ideas that will further improve and promote diversity and inclusion excellence at Rush Medical College.

Lisa is a seasoned administrative professional with a wealth of past knowledge and administrative leadership that spans two decades in such areas/positions as RMC dean’s office, RMC admissions, physician office practice, research coordinator, and medical staff office operations.   Lisa has outstanding interpersonal, communication and problem solving skills that are well befitting her new role.   Lisa will start in her new position July 29th as she transitions out from her preclinical responsibilities.


Judith Busse’s role as Special Events Manager for UME has been expanded to also include GME.  While she will continue her responsibilities as events manager for UME, her role has further been expanded to support GME and the RMC D&I strategic plan in the Office of Integrated Medical Education. In this expanded role, Judith will collaborate on related graduate medical education (residents, fellows) events including Diversity Equity Inclusion Committee meetings and events, quarterly networking and social events for URM students, residents, fellows and faculty.  She will assist in the coordination and execution of social events to bring together prospective URMs, current underrepresented students, faculty and house staff through such events as Second Look Day, Interview Day, M1 Orientation, and other recruitment events/activities.  We look forward to Judith’s attention to detail and her indomitable and collaborative spirit in her expanded role.


These three individuals are dynamic leaders who will work in a collaborative and respectful manner with key stakeholders across the continuum of medical education to assure that RMC, Office of Integrated Medical Education is well aligned with the diversity and inclusion goals and vision of Rush University Medical Center.



Please join me in congratulating Jill, Lisa and Judith in their new roles.
